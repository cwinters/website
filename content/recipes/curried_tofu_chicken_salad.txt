<h2>Curried "Chicken" Salad</h2>

<pre>
1 carton soft or firm tofu, drained
     cw: firm/extra firm works best, with the water pressed out
     for as long as possible beforehand
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup mayonnaise
Finely grated zest and juice of 1 large lime
3 TB chopped cilantro
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
1 tsp curry powder
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1 celery rib, finely diced
1 TB mango chutney
     cw: can also add 1 carrot diced, red onion diced, raisins, peanuts

1. Cut the tofu into cubes or strips about 1/3 inch across. Bring 6 cups
water to a boil, add 1 teaspoon (cw: or more...) salt and turn off the heat.
Lower the tofu into the water and let it sit for 2 minutes. Gently tip it into 
a wide colander, then rinse under cool water. Shake off the excess 
moisture and turn the tofu only a clean kitchen towel to dry.

2. Combine the remaining ingredients. Taste and adjust the seasonings, 
adding more curry powder or lime juice, if needed, to make it a little
more zesty. Add the tofu and gently toss with a rubber spatula. If
possible chill 20 minutes or more. (cw: ~2 hours STRONGLY recommended) 
The flavors will emerge and mellow as the salad stands.
