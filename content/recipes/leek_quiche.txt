<h2>Leek Quiche</h2>

<pre>
1 pound leeks
2 tablespoons butter
4 eggs beaten
3/4 cup cream
1 1/4 cups milk
1/2 pound Swiss cheese, grated into coarse pieces
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Quiche Crust, baked and cooled

Trim 1 leek, and carefully remove three or four attractive leaves for
decoration. Trim the leaves so that they will fit the top of the pie,
as if a leek had been baked whole in the pie. Blanch the leaves for a
few minutes in boiling water, drain well, and set aside to cool.

Cut each of the remaining leeks just above the spot where it begins
turning green from white. Slice each down the center, or lengthwise,
and then cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces. Wash thoroughly in cold water to
remove the dirt and grit. Drain well, and saute in the butter. Do not
overcook; these should not be discolored but rather bright and tender.

Combine the eggs, cream and milk, and stir in the Swiss cheese along
with the salt and pepper. Fill the quiche crust by adding the sauteed
leeks and covering with the egg mixture. Lay the reserved leek leaves
on top as if they were growing together - i.e., place the bottoms
together, and fan out the tops into an attractive pattern.

Bake at 375 for 30-40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center
of the pie comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can also
be served at room temperature.
