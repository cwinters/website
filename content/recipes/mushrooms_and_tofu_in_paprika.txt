<h2>Mushrooms and Tofu in Paprika Cream over Egg Noodles</h2>

<pre>
1/2 cup sour cream
1 carton firm tofu, drained
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 TB vegetable oil
1 TB butter
1 onion, finely diced
1 pound mushrooms, sliced about 1/3 inch thick
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 TB flour
1 1/2 TB mild (sweet) paprika
1/3 cup white wine or sherry
2/3 cup water, vegetable or chicken stock
2 TB chopped dill or 2 TB chopped tarragon
8 oz egg noodles

1. Let the sour cream come up to room temperature.

2. Dice the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes. Set a nonstick or cast-iron skillet
over medium-high heat and brush lightly with oil. Add the tofu and cook
until golden on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn to brown the other 
sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then remove to a dish.

3. Add the oil and butter to the pan. When it foams, add the onion and
mushrooms, squeezing the lemon over the mushrooms so they keep
their color. Cook until the mushrooms are browned and the onions are
soft, about 8 minutes. Add the tofu and gently mix together.

4. Sprinkle over the flour and paprika, then season with 1/2 teaspoon
salt and pepper. Turn the mixture to incorporate the flour, and add the 
wine, let it bubble up, then reduce until syrupy. Add the water, reduce 
the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Check once
or twice to ensure there's enough liquid to make a little sauce. If not add
more water or stock as needed. Taste for salt. Cook the egg noodles until
al dente, then drain and place on a warmed platter.

5. Rewarm the sauce, if necessary, then turn off the heat, add the fresh 
herbs and stir n the sour cream. Pour over the egg noodles and serve.
