<h2>Torta di Pere</h2>

<pre>
2 1/2 pounds pears, cored and cut into chunks 
1/4 cup sugar 
1 cup flour 
1/2 cup orange flavored liqueur, like Grand Marnier 
1 lemon, zested and grated 
4 tablespoons butter, plus more, for greasing the pan 
2 eggs 
1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
Pinch salt 
1/2 cup milk

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a large bowl, combine the pears, half the sugar, 1 tablespoon of the flour, 
and the Grand Marnier and mix well.

In a separate bowl, combine the remaining sugar and butter, cream until light 
and fluffy. Add 1 egg and the yolk of the other egg and mix well. Sift the 
remaining flour with the baking powder and salt. Add the flour in halves to 
the sugar mixture, alternating with the milk. Set the second mixture aside to 
rest for 30 minutes, divided into 2 quantities, 1 being slightly larger than the 
other.

Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and turn the larger quantity of batter into 
the cake pan. Put the pears into the pan, top with the remaining batter and 
bake for 45 minutes. Let cool and serve in wedges.
