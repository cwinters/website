<h2>Leek and Chickpea Soup</h2>

<pre>
2 cans chickpeas, rinsed
1 medium potato, diced
5 leeks cleaned and finely sliced
2 Tbs. butter
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups chicken or vegetable stock
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated (reserve some for garnish)

Boil chickpeas and diced potatoes until potatoes are just tender. 
While they're boiling, sauté leeks and garlic in a soup pot with 
the butter over medium low heat. Once the leeks have wilted down, 
add drained chickpeas and potatoes and 2 cups of the stock 
(reserve some stock for later). Bring to a boil and simmer for 
another 15 minutes.

Using a stick blender in the pot (or remove half and use a food 
processor) puree the soup, leaving some chunky to maintain a 
heartier consistency. Add as little or as much of the remaining 
stock to achieve your desired consistency. Stir in the Parmesan 
cheese to round out the flavor and add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve sprinkled with a little additional cheese and fresh 
cracked pepper.
