<h2>Angel Hair Pasta with Broccoli and Three Cheeses</h2>

<pre>
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1/2 pound broccoli, florets only
1/3 cup whipping cream
Fresh-ground pepper to taste
Salt to taste
1/2 pound angel hair pasta
1/4 pound Swiss cheese, grated
4 tablespoons Romano cheese, grated
3 tablespoons Mizithra cheese, grated
Chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Saute the garlic in the oil until it just begins to brown. Add the
yellow onion and the broccoli florets until the broccoli is barely
tender.

Add the cream and the pepper. You may add salt if you wish.

In the meantime, cook the angel hair pasta for just a few minutes in
salted boiling water. Watch this carefully because the pasta cooks in
very little time. Drain the pasta, and toss with the three
cheeses. Add the cream and the vegetables, toss and serve.

You may wish to garnish this with more cheese on top. Some parsley
might be nice as well.
