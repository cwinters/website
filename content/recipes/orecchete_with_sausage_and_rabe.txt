<h2>Orecchiette with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe</h2>

<p>Yield: 4 servings
 
<pre>
2 bunches broccoli rabe, stems trimmed 
1 pound orecchiette pasta 
3 tablespoons olive oil 
1 pound turkey Italian-style sausage, casings removed
     (cw: vegetarian sausage would probably be ok)
3 garlic cloves, minced 
Pinch dried crushed red pepper flakes 
1/4 cup grated Parmesan

Cook the broccoli rabe in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp 
tender, about 1 minute. Transfer the broccoli rabe to a large bowl of ice 
water to cool, saving the cooking water. Bring the reserved cooking water 
back to a boil. 

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage 
and cook, breaking it up into pieces with a spoon, until browned and 
juices form, about 12 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, and 
saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, when the reserved cooking water is boiling, add the orecchiette 
and cook until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 
about 8 minutes. 

Strain the broccoli rabe and add it to the pan with the sausage mixture and 
toss to coat with the juices. Add the pasta to the skillet. Stir in the Parmesan 
and serve immediately.

<h2>Simple Tomato Sauce</h2>

<pre>
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
1 small onion, chopped 
2 cloves garlic, chopped 
1 stalk celery, chopped 
1 carrot, chopped 
2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 
4 to 6 basil leaves 
2 dried bay leaves 
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional

In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and 
garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add celery and 
carrot and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, 
about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and reduce the heat to 
low. Cover the pot and simmer for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and 
taste for seasoning. If sauce tastes too acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon 
at a time, to round out the flavor.

Pour half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until 
smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce.

If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and then pour 1 to 2 
cup portions into plastic freezer bags. Freeze for up to 6 months.

Yield: 6 cups
