<h2>Broccoli and Swiss Cheese Quiche</h2>

<pre>
1 pound broccoli
1 medium yellow onion, peeled and sliced
2 tablespoons butter
1 <a href="quiche_crust.html">Quiche Crust</a>, baked and cooled
4 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup cream
1 1/4 cups milk
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 pound Swiss cheese, grated into coarse pieces

Clean the broccoli and cut into florets. Saute the onion and the
broccoli in the butter until tender but not soft.

Place the vegetables in the bottom of the quiche crust. Mix the eggs,
cream, milk, salt and pepper. Fill the shell and top with the Swiss
cheese.

Bake at 375 for 30-40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center
of the pie comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can also
be served at room temperature.
