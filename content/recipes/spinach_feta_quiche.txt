4 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup cream

Salt and papper to taste
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
1/4 pound feta cheese, crumbled
1 Quiche Crust, baked and cooled

Drain the spinach and squeeze out as much moisture s possible; it
should be fairly dry. Mix the eggs, cream and milk. Add the salt,
pepper, lemon juice and parsley. Stir in the spinach and feta
cheese. Fill the quiche crust and place the parmesan or romano on top.

of the pie comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can also
be served at room temperature.
