<h2>Italian Vegetable Saute</h2>

<pre>
4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
1 head cauliflower, divided into florets
3 small zucchini, sliced
2 cloves garlic, sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 yellow onions, peeled and sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup stock (beef, etc.)
2 tablespoons grated parmesan or romano

In a pot of boiling water blanch the carrots -- i.e., boil them for
about 5 to 6 minutes, or until they are tender; remove and cool. Add
the cauliflower to the same boiling water and cook until barely
tender; remove, and cool. Add the zucchini to the pot, but do not cook
long at all.

When you are ready to serve dinner, in a large frying pan or a wok
saute the grlic in the olive oil. Add the carrots, cauliflower,
zucchini, and onions. Toss for a few minutes, and then add the salt,
pepper, and beef stock. Cover the pan, and cook just long enough to
heat everything through. Stir gently often. Sprinkle the cheese on
top, and cheese on top, and serve.
