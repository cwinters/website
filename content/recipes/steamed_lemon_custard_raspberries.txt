<h2>Steamed Lemon Custard with Raspberries</h2>

<pre>
Yield: 2 servings
 
2 large egg whites 
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
1/2 lemon, zested and juiced 
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
3 tablespoons cake flour 
1/4 cup sugar 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
20 fresh raspberries, plus more for garnish 
Fresh mint leaves, for garnish 
Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting

In a large bowl with an electric mixer or wire whisk, beat the 
egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tartar, lemon juice, 
zest, and vanilla extract; continue to whip until the whites hold 
soft peaks. Sift the cake flour, sugar, and salt, together; gently 
fold the dry ingredients into the whites with a rubber spatula. 

Take 2 (6-ounce) ramekins and put 10 raspberries in the bottom 
of each. Spoon the batter into the ramekins and set them in a 
bamboo steamer with a lid. Heat 2-inches of water in a wok over 
medium flame, set the steamer in the wok and steam the custard 
for 15 to 20 minutes. 

Run a thin knife around edges of the ramekins and turn upside 
down onto plates. Garnish with raspberries, mint, and a dusting 
of confectioners’ sugar.

VARIATION: To steam the custard at the same time as the Black 
Bass in Miso Soup entree, simply prepare the batter before 
assembling the steamers. Wrap the ramekins in plastic wrap (so 
they won't smell of fish) and put them in the top tier of the bamboo 
steamer. Steam everything together as directed in the recipe.
