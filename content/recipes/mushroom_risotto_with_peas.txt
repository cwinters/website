<h2>Mushroom Risotto with Peas</h2>

<p>Yield: 6 servings
 
<pre>
8 cups canned low-salt chicken broth (cw: vegetable broth)
1/2-ounce dried porcini mushrooms 
1/4 cup unsalted butter 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
2 cups finely chopped onions 
10 ounces white mushrooms, finely chopped 
2 garlic cloves, minced 
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice or short-grain white rice 
2/3 cup dry white wine 
3/4 cup frozen peas, thawed 
2/3 cup grated Parmesan 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, optional

Bring the broth to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan. Add the 
porcini mushrooms. Set aside until the mushrooms are tender, about 
5 minutes. Keep the broth warm over very low heat.

Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add 
olive oil. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. 

Add the white mushrooms and garlic. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 
the porcini mushrooms to a cutting board. Finely chop the mushrooms 
and add to the saucepan. Saute until the mushrooms are tender and 
the juices evaporate, about 5 minutes. 

Stir in the rice and let it toast  for a few minutes. Add the wine; 
cook until the liquid is absorbed stirring often, about 2 minutes. 
Add 1 cup of hot broth; simmer over medium-low heat until 
the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes. 

Continue to cook until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, 
adding more broth by cupfuls and stirring often, about 28 minutes 
(the rice will absorb 6 to 8 cups of broth). Stir in the peas. Mix in 
the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
