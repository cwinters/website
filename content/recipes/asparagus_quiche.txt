<h2>Asparagus Quiche</h2>

<pre>
1 pound fresh asparagus, or 1 package frozen spears
2 tablespoons butter
1 <a href="quiche_crust.html">Quiche Crust</a>, baked and cooled
4 eggs, beaten
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
Salt and pepper to taste

Clean the asparagus, or defrost and drain the frozen asparagus. Cut up
into inch long pieces and saute in the butter to remove some of the
moisture. The asparagus should be tender and green, not soft.

Place the asparagus in the bottom of the crust. Mix the eggs, cream,
milk, dill weed, salt and pepper. Fill the crust, and bake at 375 for
30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center of the pie
comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can also be served
at room temperature.
