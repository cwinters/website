<h2>Green Beans and Lettuce</h2>

<pre>
Roux of 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon flour
1 10-ounce package frozen green beans, French or jullienne cut
1/2 cup broth (Chicken, etc.)
1 medium yellow onion, peeled and sliced
1/4 teaspoon sugar
Salt and pepper to taste
Pinch each of dried dill weed and thyme
1 medium head iceberg lettuce

Prepare the roux by stirring the butter and flower together over
medium heat until the flour begins to turn very light brown. Set
aside.

Place the beans in a 3-quart saucepan along with the chicken broth and
onion. Simmer until the beans are tender, and then add the sugar,
salt, pepper, dill, and thyme. Simmer for 1 minute. Cut the lettuce
into slices across the grain, and place in the pot. Cook for 3
minutes, and thicken with the roux.
