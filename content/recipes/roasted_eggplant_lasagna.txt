1 1/2 lbs. eggplant, peeled, quartered lengthwise and cut 
   lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices
4 medium ripe tomatoes (2 lbs.), halved lengthwise
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, shredded
9 oz. fresh spinach or Swiss chard, steamed
3/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese (3 1/2 oz.)
3/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
8 oz. soft tofu, mashed with a fork
2 Tbs. grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 egg white
6 no-boil lasagna noodles (7 x 3 1/2 inches each)

1. Preheat oven to 450F. Coat two roasting pans and one 
8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.

2. Place eggplant in one roasting pan and sprinkle with 
1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper. Place 
tomato halves in second roasting pan, skin side up. Roast 
eggplant and tomatoes until tender, tossing eggplant 
occasionally, 30 to 40 minutes.

3. Remove and discard tomato skins. Reserve 1/4 cup tomatoes. 
Place eggplant, remaining tomatoes and their juices in a large 
bowl. Add basil and toss, using spatula to break up tomatoes; set aside.

4. Reduce oven temperature to 375 F.

5. Steam spinach or chard until wilted, 4 to 6 minutes; set 
aside to cool. Chop.

6. In a large bowl, combine mozzarella, ricotta, tofu, 1 Tbs. 
Parmesan and egg white; mix well.

7. Place 2 lasagna noodles in bottom of prepared baking dish. 
Top with half of the cheese mixture, half of the eggplant strips 
and half of the spinach. Repeat layers, and top final layer of 
pasta with reserved 1/4 cup tomatoes. Sprinkle with Asiago cheese 
and remaining 1 Tbs. Parmesan.

8. Loosely cover lasagna with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes; 
uncover and continue baking until cheese is golden, about 15 
minutes more. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
