<h2>Almond Apple Crumb Pie</h2>

<pre>
Serves: 8-12
Time: 20 min prep + 1 hour bake
Source: Odense almond paste box

Shell:

* 150-200g almond paste, room temperature
* 1 fresh (see recipe below) or frozen pie shell

Filling:

* 3 medium granny smith apples
* 3 medium golden delicious apples
* 1/4 cup or 1/2 dl sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 cup unsweetened, dried cranberries or raisins (optional)

Crumb Topping:

* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 cup or 1,2 dl all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup or 1,2 dl uncooked oats
* 1/2 cup or 1,2 dl brown sugar
* 6 tablespoons or 85g cold butter, cut into small pieces
* 1/4 cup or 1/2 dl chopped almonds

Cut pie dough into two pieces. Roll one portion into a circle large 
enough for your pie pan. Let rest for a few minutes and place into pie
pan. Press lightly into the pan. Trim the edge, leaving a bit of 
excess around the pan, with scissors and roll the trimmed dough 
overhang under with your fingers so that it is even with the edge of 
the pan. Crimp the dough to create a fluted edge or make a pretty 
'sheaves of wheat' edge that looks pretty and is easy to do. Set 
aside.

Peel, core and slice apples. Squirt a little lemon juice on the slices 
to reduce browning. Combine apple slices in a bowl with sugar, 
cinnamon, nutmeg and cranberries/raisins. Set aside to macerate.

Preheat oven to 375F/190C.

In bowl, combine topping ingredients and mix together with a fork or 
pastry blender until crumbly.

Roll almond paste between 2 sheets of baking paper to form a disc that
will fit in the bottom of your pie shell. Trim with a knife to form a 
smooth edge and press into the bottom of the unbaked pie shell.

Stir macerated apples and spoon into pie shell, arranging apple slices
so that they lie flat and close together. Spoon crumb topping evenly 
over the apples.

Bake for 50-60 minutes until golden brown and bubbly.

<h2>Flaky Pie Dough</h2>

<pre>
Makes: 2 10" pie shells
Time: 10 minutes prep + 1-2 hours chilling
Source: The Professional Pastry Chef

* 360g or 13oz bread flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 225g or 2 sticks cold butter, cut into small pieces
* 70g or 5 tablespoons cold baking margarine or shortening, 
  cut into small pieces
* 80ml or 1/3 cup ice cold water

Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the firm butter and 
shortening to the flour and pinch butter with your fingers or cut in 
butter with a pastry blender until fat is the size of small pebbles.

Add the ice water and mix with your hands until the dough comes 
together, but still a little lumpy. Gather dough into a ball. Flatten 
into a disc and place in the refrigerator to rest for 1-2 hours. This 
step is important to allow the dough to hydrate.
