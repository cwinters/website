<h2>Spaghettini with Checca Sauce</h2>

<p>Yield: 4 servings
 
<pre>
8 ounces spaghettini or angel hair pasta 
4 scallions (white and pale green parts only), coarsely chopped 
3 garlic cloves, crushed 
1 (12-ounce container) cherry tomatoes, halved 
1 (1-ounce) piece Parmesan, coarsely chopped 
8 to 10 fresh basil leaves 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
3 tablespoons olive oil 
4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, tender 
but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the next 7 ingredients in a food processor. Pulse just 
until the tomatoes are coarsely chopped (do not puree).

Drain the pasta, reserving some of the pasta water. Toss the pasta with 
the tomato mixture and fresh mozzarella in a large bowl. Add some of the 
reserved pasta water (about 1/4 cup) if the sauce looks dry. Serve immediately.
