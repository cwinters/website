1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced
2 ripe tomatoes, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste

1/2 cup dry red wine
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup grated parmesan or romano

In a large frying pan saute the garlic in the oil until it is lightly
browned. Add the onion and saute until it is cler. Add the tomatoes,
salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. Simmer for a few minutes, and add
the zucchini. Cook for about 5 minutes on high heat, or until the
moisture is almost gone.
