<h2>Baked Baley Casserole</h2>

<pre>
1 cup barley
Butter
3 tablespoons olive oil or peanut oil
2 or 3 yellow onions, peeled and chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
6 cups stock (chicken, beef, etc.)

Brown the barley in a little butter and the oil. Place in a
casserole. Brown the yellow onions in butter, and add them to the
barley. Add the salt and pepper. Add 3 cups chicken or beef broth,
cover and place in 350 oven for about 1 hour, or until moisture is
almost absorbed. Add another 3 cups broth and cook, covered, until
absorbed. (Yes, that is right: 1 cup barley to 6 cups broth.)
