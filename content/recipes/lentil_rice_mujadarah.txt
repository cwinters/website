<pre>
Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 medium onions, finely chopped
1 tsp salt, plus more for serving
4 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
4 c. water
1 c. lentils, rinsed and picked through
1 c. long grain brown rice

optional (non tradional):
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/16 tsp ground allspice

Directions:

-Heat oil in large sauce pan over medium heat.

-Add onions and salt and cook until they are deeply
 caramelized. (This takes a while but be patient).

-After about 35-60 minutes (usually takes me about 45 minutes)
 the onions will be a rich amber color and darker in spots. (Make
 sure not to burn, it will turn the taste of the entire dish.)

-When the onions are ready add the garlic and spices and stir
 until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

-Add water and deglaze the pan, scraping up all browned bits.

-Add lentils and bring to a boil.

-Cover pan and cook for 15 minutes.

-Add rice and stir to combine.

-Recover pan and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or until rice
 is done.

-Mix thoroughly, cover and turn heat off.

-Let sit until slightly cooled and thickened, with no liquid left
 in the pan.

-It is now ready to serve: plate and season with salt and pepper
 to bring out taste.

Usually topped with labneh. Can be accompanied by a simple salad
and flatbread or with a full meal of kibbeh and chicken with
hashwey rice.
