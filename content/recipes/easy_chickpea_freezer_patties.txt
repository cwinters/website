<h2>Easy Chickpea Freezer Patties</h2>

<p><em>(makes 4 patties)</em></p>

<pre?
3 cups ready-to-eat chickpeas, either canned or 
  soaked overnight and boiled about 1 hour until tender, drained
1/4 cup carrots, finely chopped
1/4 cup green or red bell pepper, finely chopped
2-3 sundried tomatoes, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 large scallion, chopped
1 egg
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and black pepper to taste
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add the
coriander seeds and cook about 3 minutes, shaking the pan
occasionally. Remove and repeat with the cumin seeds another 2
minutes. Transfer seeds to a small bowl (or a real mortar and
pestle) and crush with the back of a broad, flat object.

In the same pan, heat a tablespoon of oil and add the
(well-drained) chickpeas. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper
and the cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
chickpeas develop a slight browned crust on the surface. Reduce
heat, and add the carrots, bell pepper, sundried tomatoes and
another tablespoon of oil. Season with another pinch of salt and
pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 1-2
minutes. Remove from heat.

Once slightly cooled, transfer the chickpea mixture as well as
the scallions and garlic to a food processor. Pulse about five
seconds, or until slightly chunky but evenly so. Transfer to a
bowl. Taste for seasoning, adding a little extra salt, pepper or
cayenne if desired. Add the egg and stir to fully combine. Form
mixture into four equal patties.

Heat the last tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Cook patties on
each side for a couple minutes until just lightly browned. Let
cool. Serve immediately or wrap with plastic to reheat in the
oven, microwave or pan.
