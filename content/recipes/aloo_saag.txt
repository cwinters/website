<h2>Aloo Saag</h2>

<pre>
1 lb. fresh spinach leaves, washed well (or frozen if you must)
2 cups 1/3"-dice potato (about 6 new potatoes)
4 fat cloves garlic
1/2 medium yellow onion
1/2 tsp. turmeric
1/2 tsp. salt, plus more as needed
1 tsp. garam masala
3 Tbsps. milk, plus more as needed
crushed red pepper to taste

serves 2 as main dish, 4-6 as a side
time 20-30 minutes

1. Wash the spinach leaves well and drain. Toss them in a pot along 
with a 1/2 cup of water. Heat on high for a few minutes, stirring, 
until the water starts to steam and the bottom leaves begin to wilt. 
Give it a good stir, cover, lower heat, and cook for about 7 minutes, 
until just tender. Drain (don't worry about getting out all the 
water.) Puree until smooth in a blender or food processor.

2. Meanwhile, toss the diced potatoes in a pot with water to cover, 
and bring to a boil. Add a ½ tsp. of salt. Cook the potatoes for about
10-15 minutes, until tender. Drain.

3. Cut off the root ends of the garlic cloves and lay cloves flat. 
Lightly pound with the side of your knife blade and peel off the 
papery skin. Finely mince up the garlic. Peel and finely mince the 
onion as well.

4. Heat up a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a good-sized sauté 
pan. Cook the garlic and onion over medium heat until soft and 
yummy-smelling. Stir in the turmeric and cook a minute or two more.

5. Toss in the spinach puree and potatoes and stir well. Add the milk,
salt, garam masala and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper to taste. 
Bring to a low bubble, and cook a few minutes more to let the flavors 
meld. If the mixture looks too dry, add a little more milk. Enjoy!
