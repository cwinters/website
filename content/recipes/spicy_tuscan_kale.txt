<h2>Tuscan Kale</h2>

<pre>
3   bunches Lacinato Kale, (about 3 pounds), stems and ribs
    discarded, leaves torn into large pieces and washed 
3   tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
4   flat filet anchovies in olive oil, preferably jarred variety
3/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
2   medium onions, large dice, (about 2 cups)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
4   garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 cup toasted breadcrumbs
</pre>

<p>Bring 4-6 quarts of water and 1 teaspoon of salt to boil in a
large pot. Plunge the kale into the water and cook for one
minute. The color will become a vibrant green within this
time. Remove the kale to a colander under cold running water to
stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.</p>

<p>Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-large skillet over
medium heat and add the anchovies, pressing and stirring them
into the oil until they disintegrate. Add the onions, red pepper
flakes, salt, and pepper, and stir over medium-high heat for 8-10
minutes until they become translucent and soft. Add the kale to
the onions along with the garlic and the last tablespoon of olive
oil. Stir occasionally until everything comes together in a soft
mass for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and toss with
breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.</p>
