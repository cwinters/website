<h2>Twelve-minute Bouillabaisse</h2>

<pre>
The down-to-earth roots of bouillabaisse have been subverted by a
gourmet mystique. There is no official recipe for this colloquial
fish stew, but for the best results, use a combination of seafood
and lean and fatty fish.

1 Tbsp      olive oil
1 cup       diced onions, frozen or fresh
2 tsp       chopped garlic, jarred or fresh

1 tsp       herbes de Provence
1 Tbsp      dried orange peel
1 cup       white wine

1 cup       boiling water
1 large     (9 grams) seafood bouillon cube

2/3 cup     orange juice
1 can       diced tomatoes with juice (14.5 oz.)
to taste    salt & black pepper

1 lb        ready-to-cook seafood, thawed if frozen
            (shrimp, scallops, squid, fish fillets)

Heat the oil over med-high heat in a large saucepan.
Add the onions and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.

Add the herbes de Provence, orange peel, and garlic, and
stir to combine. Add the wine and bring to a boil.

Add the boiling water and bouillon cube, and stir until
the cube dissolves.

Add the orange juice, tomatoes, salt, and pepper, and
simmer for 1 minute.

Add the seafood and simmer until cooked through,
about 3 minutes.

Addendum: 

A friend writes: 
I usually use salmon, scallops or squid, and chopped anchovies.
Also, I can never find seafood bouillon, so I end up using seafood stock
