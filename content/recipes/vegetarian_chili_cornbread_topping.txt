<h2>Vegetarian Chili With Corn Bread Topping</h2>

<pre>
For the chili:
2 TB olive oil
2 medium onions, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups red bell peppers (about 2 large peppers), finely diced
2 tsp hot red pepper flakes
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
3 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
1 1/2 cups red lentils
3 cups canned chopped tomatoes
3 1/2 cups drained canned kidney beans
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 TB unsweetened cocoa powder

For the corn bread topping:
1 tsp salt
2 cups cornmeal
2 TB flour
3 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs
1 tsp honey
2 TB vegetable oil
1 cup coarsely grated Cheddar cheese

For serving:
2 cups sour cream
1 cup chopped cilantro.

1. To prepare chili, heat olive oil over medium-low heat in a deep, 
wide pan with a lid. Add onions, garlic and bell peppers, and sauté 
until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes, coriander,
cumin and cardamom pods. Stir in lentils.
	
2. Add chopped tomatoes, kidney beans, ketchup, tomato paste, cocoa 
and 3 cups water. Stir well. Cover, and simmer, stirring frequently, 
until mixture is thickened and beans are tender, about 45 minutes. 
Chili can be made ahead to this point and topping added later. (In 
that case, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days, bringing to room 
temperature before proceeding.)

3. For corn bread topping, heat oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl,
combine salt, cornmeal, flour, baking powder and cinnamon. In a 
separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, honey and oil. Pour 
liquid ingredients into dry; stir until combined.

4. Pour chili into a baking dish 13 by 9 by 3 inches. Spread corn 
bread topping evenly over chili, and sprinkle cheese on topping. Bake 
until topping has risen and turned golden brown, about 25 minutes.

5. Remove from oven, and let chili stand about 5 minutes. To serve, 
cut into squares, and pass sour cream and cilantro at the table.

Yield: 8 servings.
