<h2>Cumin-spiked Tofu Recipe</h2>

<p>
It is important to let the marinating tofu do its thing (at the very least) for a few hours - preferably overnight. I'll also mention that I always seek out organic soy products.
</p>

<pre>
12 ounces extra-firm organic tofu
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon garam masala spice blend
6 medium cloves garlic, crushed then chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed
1 7 or 8-ounce container of Greek yogurt

Unwrap the tofu. Dry it off by patting and pressing 
with a few paper towels. Cut the tofu into slabs roughly 
the size of a business card, with the thickness of a pencil.

In a wide, shallow rimmed dish (a tart pan or pie dish 
works great) whisk together all the remaining ingredients. 
Place the tofu in the marinade in a single layer and gently 
coat the tofu with the yogurt. Cover and refrigerate for 
(at least) a few hours. I sometimes leave it marinating for 
a few days, cooking the tofu when needed.

In a grill pan, or on a grill, cook the tofu (retaining some 
of the yogurt slather on each piece) over medium heat until 
the tofu is cooked through and the surface of the tofu has 
nice color. Flip once along the way. If the pan/grill is too 
hot the outside of the tofu will overcook before the inside 
is hot, so be mindful of this.
