<h2>Quiche Crust</h2>

<pre>
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
Salt (optional)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup milk

Mix the flour and the baking powder together. Add salt if you
wish. Mix the oil and milk together, and then pour into the
flour. Stir only until mixed. The mixture will be rather coarse and
granular, but it will roll out well. Do not overmix. Mold into two
balls, and wrap with plastic. Allow to sit for 15 minutes.

Each half will make one 9-inch piecrust. If you are using a large
French quiche pan, then use a bit more of the dough. Roll out between
two sheets of wax paper.

Place the pasty in the quiche pan or pie plate, and prick the bottom
with a kitchen fork. Line the inside with wax paper or aluminum
foil. Put two cups of dry beans into the piecrust, and bake at 400 for
12 minutes. Save the beans for the next piecrust session. The shell is
now ready for filling and cooking.
