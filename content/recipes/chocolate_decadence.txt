<pre>
7 oz or 200g sweet dark chocolate (70% cacao)*
7 oz or 200g unsweetened chocolate (85%+ cacao)*
3/4 cup or 150ml water
6 oz or 170g granulated sugar
2.25 sticks or 255g butter, room temperature
6 eggs, room temperature
3 oz or or 85g granulated sugar

Generously butter the inside of a round 10-inch/25cm cake pan or springform pan. Cut 
baking paper to fit in the bottom of the cake pan, place on the bottom and butter the top 
of the paper as well. Set pan aside.

Chop chocolate into small pieces and place on a sheet of baking paper. Slice butter into 
small pieces, too, and place on baking paper.

In a saucepan big enough to hold the chocolate and butter, bring the water and 170g of 
sugar to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and quickly stir in the chocolate until 
it is completely melted and smooth. Add the butter and stir in until melted and the 
mixture is again smooth. Set aside and allow to cool until it is only warm to the touch.

In a large bowl, whip the eggs with the 85g of sugar at high speed until it is light and 
fluffy (about 3 minutes). Do not whip the eggs as you would for a sponge cake as too 
much air will make the cake dry, crumbly and difficult to slice. Slowly pour the cool or 
warm melted chocolate into the egg mixture. Try to pour it down the side of the bowl and 
not directly onto the egg mixture. Mix together gently and well.

Pour mixture into prepared pan and carefully place it into a pan filled with a small amount 
of water and add water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan. If you use a 
springform pan, wrap the pan in a layer of aluminum foil to prevent leaking.

Bake immediately at 175C/350F for about 30-40 minutes or until the top feels firm. Be 
careful not to overbake the cake. Allow the cake to cool for an hour and then refrigerate 
for a minimum of two hours or, even better, overnight.

To remove the cake from the pan place in a shallow pan of warm water and run a knife 
carefully around the edge. Invert onto a plate and gently tap around the top if it is slow to 
unmold. Remove the pan and carefully peel off the baking paper. If you used a springform, 
run a warm knife around the edge, remove the band, place a plate on top of the cake and 
flip over onto the plate. Remove the bottom and then remove the baking paper on top.

Using a thin, sharp knife dipped in hot water, slice the cake while it is cold and allow to 
warm up before serving. Serve with a raspberry or strawberry sauce/puree and sour 
cream.

* You can also just use 400g/14oz of 70% semi-sweet/bittersweet dark chocolate instead.
