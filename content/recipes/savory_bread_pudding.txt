<h2>Savory Bread Pudding Casserole</h2>

<pre>
Serves 8

Before you start assembling this hearty dish, steam the 
spinach first, using just the water remaining on its 
leaves after rinsing. The steaming wilts the spinach so 
that it is easy to work with. You may prefer to layer all 
the cheese on top instead of interspersing it throughout.

1 Tbs. olive oil
3 large eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 tsp. hot sauce
1/2 tsp. salt
4 cups diced stale bread
1 lb. spinach, well rinsed and wilted
1 cup corn kernels, preferably scraped from cob
1 cup chopped scallions
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

   1. Preheat oven to 325F. Lightly oil bottom and sides 
of high-sided 9x13-inch pan or soufflé dish.
   2. Beat eggs until light and fluffy. Add milk, hot 
sauce and salt, and mix. Depending on size of dish, pour 1
/3 to 1/2 of milk mixture into pan, add 1/3 to 1/2 of bread 
cubes, and push down into milk mixture. Layer in about 1/3 
to 1/2 of spinach, then corn, scallions, bell pepper and 1 
cup cheese. Repeat layering, reserving 1 cup cheese and some 
milk mixture. When complete, pour last of milk mixture over 
top, making sure it soaks all bread.
   3. Bake 1 hour. Top with remaining 1 cup cheese, and 
return to oven to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, 
and serve while hot.
