<p>MAKES 10 SERVINGS

<pre>
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup heavy cream (use half milk, if desired)
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (16-ounce) bag frozen cut leaf spinach, thawed and well drained
1 (13 3/4-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, rinsed and well 
   drained
2/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup prepared salsa
Crackers or tortilla chips, for serving

1. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the cream 
cheese, cream, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder until smooth and 
creamy. Add the spinach and process until thoroughly mixed. Add the 
artichokes and process just until coarsely chopped.

2. Turn the mixture into a 3 1/2-quart electric slow cooker; smooth 
the top.

3. Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until
hot in the center. Sprinkle the top evenly with the Jack cheese and 
spoon the salsa in a ring around the inside edges of the slow cooker. 
Cover and continue heating on high 15 minutes longer, or until the 
cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to the low setting and serve warm 
with crackers or tortilla chips for dipping. Refrigerate any 
leftovers.
