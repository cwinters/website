<pre>
Serves 8

If you’re torn between serving regular potatoes or sweet potatoes, 
try this spectacular dish, which calls for both.

4 Tbs. unsalted butter
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 lb.)
3 Russet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 lb.)
1 tsp. dried thyme leaves
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
1 medium-sized leek, trimmed, quartered and white part finely 
    chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Melt 1 Tbs. butter in 8-inch ovenproof 
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Swirl pan to coat bottom and 
sides; set aside.

2. Toss sweet potatoes with 1 1/2 Tbs. butter, 1/2 tsp. thyme, 
1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper in medium bowl. Set aside.

3. Toss Russet potatoes with remaining butter, thyme, salt and 
pepper in second bowl.

4. Place one layer of Russet potatoes in overlapping circles on 
bottom of skillet. Sprinkle with leeks, and top with layer of 
sweet potatoes. Sprinkle with 1 Tbs. Parmesan. Repeat layering, 
ending with layer of sweet potato slices.

5. Cook potatoes 5 minutes over medium heat to brown bottom. 
Transfer skillet to oven, and bake 45 to 50 minutes, or until 
potatoes are tender and beginning to brown. Set 9-inch plate on 
top of skillet. Flip upside down to unmold potatoes. Slice into 
wedges, and serve.
