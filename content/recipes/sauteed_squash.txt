<h2>Sauteed Squash</h2>

<p>You can also add parsley and carrots to this dish; cook the carrots
separately. The author once added a whipped egg at the very last
minute.</p>

<p>All possibilities will go well for you as long as you remember the
cardinal rule concerning the cooking of light summer squashes:
Don't. Don't cook it to death. Rather simply get it hot and serve it.</p>

<pre>
3 small zucchini
1 medium yellow summer squash
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced thin
1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced thin
2 ounces dried mushrooms, soaked in warm water drained
     and chopped or 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons whipping cream
3 tablespoons white wine
2 tablespoons grated parmesan or romano

Cut squashes into matchsticks, or use a very coarse grater. Heat the
oil in a large frying pan or wok and saute the garlic and onion until
barely tender.

Add the squashes, mushrooms, salt and pepper, and saute for a few
minutes until the vegetables are hot. Add the cream and white
wine. Cook for a moment, and place in a serving bowl. Top with the
cheese.
