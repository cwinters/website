<pre>
INGREDIENTS
(12 oz) frozen fake meat
(3) tb olive oil
(1) onion (BIG), chopped
(2) carrots, sliced (if they're really fat, slice in 
    half lengthwise, then normally)
(2) celery stalks, cut in half lengthwise, then
    sliced across
(1) red bell pepper, chopped
(1) green bell pepper, chopped
(1) zucchini, chopped
(3) chili peppers, minced (roasting is good, but not
    necessary; I used a jalapeno, a green serrano and a 
    red serrano)
(1) chipotle pepper w/adobo sauce, minced
(1-2) tsp dried oregano
(1-2) tsp dried basil
(1-5) pinches cayenne pepper
(2-4) tsp cumin
(1-2) tsp coriander
(1-2) tsp cinnamon
(1) pinch nutmeg
(4) 15 oz cans diced tomatoes
(3/4) 15 oz can tomato sauce
(1) 15 oz can kidney beans
(1) 15 oz can black beans
(1) tb honey
(4-8) cloves garlic, minced
(taste) salt and pepper

In a skillet warm up the fake meat with a little nonstick spray.

In a large pot over medium to medium-high heat, warm up the oil. Once
hot add the onions, carrots, celery, and bell peppers. Cook for about 
five or seven minutes, stirring. Add the zucchini, cook for two or 
three more minutes, then add the fake meat, chili peppers and 
seasonings. Stir together and cook for a minute. Bring down the heat 
to medium or just under and add the tomatoes, beans and honey and cook
 for ten minutes. Add the garlic and stir well. Turn down the heat to 
simmer and let it stew for at least twenty minutes.
