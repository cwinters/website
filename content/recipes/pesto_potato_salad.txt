PESTO:  In food processor, place 1/4 cup nuts, 3 garlic cloves, 2 
cups packed fresh basil leaves and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley; 
process until finely ground.  With motor running, gradually add 2/3 
cup olive oil until pesto is the consistency of mayonnaise.  Add 
freshly ground pepper to taste.  Transfer to a small jar and pour a 
thin film of olive oil over surface of pesto.  Cover tightly and 
store in refrigerator.
