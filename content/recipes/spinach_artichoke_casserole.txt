<h2>Spinach and Artichoke Casserole</h2>

<pre>
1 9-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, defrosted, or
    1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts
3 10-ounce packages frozen chopped spinach, defrosted
1/2 pound cream cheese
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
4 tablespoons butter or olive oil
6 tablespoons milk
Pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated parmesan or romano

If frozen artichokes used, cook according to instructions. Do not
overcook. Drain the artichokes, and place them on bottom of a 3-quart
casserole. Squeeze as much moisture as possible from the spinach and
layer it on top of the artichokes. In an electrix mixer blend the
cream cheese, mayonnaise, and butter or oil until light and
fluffy. Gradually beat in the milk, and spread this mixture over the
top of the spinach. Sprinkle with pepper and the cheese.
