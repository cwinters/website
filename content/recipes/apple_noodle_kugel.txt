<h2>Apple Noodle Kugel</h2>

<pre>
Makes: about 12 servings
Time: about 20 minutes prep + bake time

* 12 oz or 350g wide flat egg noodles (short noodles are better)
* 3 unpeeled granny smith apples, shredded
* 1 stick or 113g butter
* 8 oz or 250g small curd cottage cheese, creamed
* 1 cup or 250g sour cream/kermaviili/creme fraîche
* 3 eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 cup or 2,25 dl sugar
* 1/2 cup or 1,25 dl golden or regular raisins (or maybe try 
  chopped pineapple)
* mixture of light brown sugar and cinnamon to sprinkle over the top

Cook pasta in rapidly boiling water for about 7 minutes, drain 
and set aside to cool.

Preheat oven to 350F/175C.

Shred/grate apples into the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Melt 
butter in a glass measuring cup in the microwave and pour in with 
the apples. Stir in cheese, sour cream, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, 
sugar and fruit. Mix well and stir in noodles with a big spoon, 
coating the noodles well and evenly distributing the ingredients.

Pour into large casserole or shallow baking pan, sprinkle top 
with brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and bake for about an hour 
or so until the top is browned. Serve warm with ice cream or 
vanilla sauce.
