<h2>Ricotta Kisses (Baci di Ricotta)</h2>

<p>Time: 20 minutes</p>

<pre>
1 cup ricotta
2 large eggs
1/2 cup Italian 00 flour (note below)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon superfine sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Vegetable oil for frying
2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar.

1. In a medium bowl, combine ricotta and eggs, and mix until smooth. 
Add flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla. Mix again
to make a smooth batter.

2. Fill a wide, shallow skillet with about  3/8 inch of oil. Place 
over medium-high heat until a bit of batter sizzles when dropped in. 
Drop rounded teaspoons of batter into pan, 5 or 6 at a time. When 
batter puffs and undersides turn golden brown, after about 1 minute, 
flip kisses and allow to brown again for about 1 more minute. Transfer
browned kisses to paper towels to drain, and continue until all batter
is used.
	
3. Pile kisses in a rough pyramid on a serving plate. Pass 
confectioners' sugar through a small fine-meshed sieve evenly over 
baci. Serve immediately.

Yield: About 30 kisses, or 6 servings.
