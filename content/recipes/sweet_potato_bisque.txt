<h2>Sweet Potato Bisque with Shiitake Mushrooms</h2>

<pre>
6 Tbs. unsalted butter
3 medium-sized carrots, peeled and diced
1 large yellow onion, peeled and chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
4 cups vegetable stock
3/4 cup dry white wine
1 lb. sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 herb bundle (about 30 stems fresh parsley and 
    6 to 10 stems fresh thyme)
5 oz. shiitake mushrooms, wiped clean, stems and 
    caps separated
1 cup tomato purée
6 scallions, trimmed and finely minced
1/2 cup heavy cream, or more to taste
1/4 tsp. ground white pepper
1/4 tsp. cayenne, or to taste
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

1. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat.
 Add carrots and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes
 or until onions are translucent. Remove from heat, add garlic and cook, 
stirring constantly, just until garlic releases its fragrance.

2. Add vegetable stock, wine, sweet potatoes, herb bundle, shiitake 
stems and tomato purée and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low 
and cook 30 minutes, or until potatoes and carrots are soft. Discard herb 
bundle and shiitake stems.

3. Meanwhile, prepare topping: Heat remaining butter in skillet over 
medium heat. Add scallions and cook for 2 to 5 minutes, or until softened. 
Dice shiitake caps, add to skillet, and cook and stir until tender, about 3 
minutes. Set aside.

4. Use slotted spoon to transfer solids from saucepan to bowl of food 
processor, reserving cooking liquid. Purée vegetables until very smooth, 
adding 1/2 cup stock, if necessary. Return purée to saucepan and stir to 
mix. Add 1/2 cup cream and heat through. Add white pepper and cayenne. 
Adjust seasonings and serve with shiitake-scallion garnish.
