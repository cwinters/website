<h2>Penne with Spinach Sauce</h2>

<pre>
1 pound whole wheat or multi grain penne
3 garlic cloves
2 ounces goat cheese
1 ounce reduced fat cream cheese
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
6 ounces fresh baby spinach leaves
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
 
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add 
the penne and cook until it is tender but still 
firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 12 
minutes.
 
Mince the garlic in a food processor. Add the goat
cheese, cream cheese, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 
teaspoon of pepper, and half of the spinach 
leaves. Blend until the mixture is smooth and 
creamy. Set the cheese and spinach mixture aside.
 
Meanwhile, place the remaining spinach leaves in a 
large bowl.
 
Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking 
liquid. Spoon the pasta atop the spinach leaves in
the bowl. Scrape the cheese and spinach mixture 
over the pasta mixture and toss to coat, adding 
enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten. Season 
the pasta, to taste, with salt and pepper. 

Sprinkle the Parmesan over and serve.
