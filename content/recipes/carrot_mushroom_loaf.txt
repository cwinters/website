<h2>Carrot-Mushroom Loaf</h2>

<p>I don't know why this is called a loaf, since it is baked in a 9x13-inch pan. But it's been called a loaf for so long, I hate to tamper with tradition. The original version had 4 TB butter and 5 eggs. Now it's been pared down to 1 TB butter and 2 eggs. Also, the amount of vegetables has been increased, keeping the yield at a good 6 to 8 servings -- although it's a hard dish to stop eating, especially if it comes out of the oven when everyone is hungry.</p>

<p>A food processor fitted with the grating attachment makes short work of this casserole. Use it first to make the bread crumbs, then to grate both the carrots and the cheese -- without cleaning it in between.</p>

<p>You can use store-bought bread crumbs, but homemade ones will make this dish taste exceptional. To make superb bread crumbs, the trick is to use superb bread.</p>

<p>NOTE: Once baked this casserole can be frozen. It reheats beautifully.</p>

<pre>
2 cups minced onion
1 TB butter
1 lb mushrooms, chopped
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp basil
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp dill
3-4 medium cloves garlic (cw: 6-8)
1 1/2 lbs carrots, grated (about 6 cups)
2 cups superb bread crumbs
1 cup (packed) grated cheddar
2 eggs, beaten
black pepper, to taste
OPTIONAL TOPPINGS: extra dill, cheese, bread crumbs, sesame seeds
     (any, some, or all -- all == great)

Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking pan. Preheat the oven to 350F.

In a large skillet saute onions in butter over medium heat for about 
5 minutes. Add mushrooms, salt, herbs and garlic, and continue
to saute for about 10 more minutes.

In a large bowl combine carrots, bread crumbs, cheese, eggs, and
pepper. Add the sauteed mixture and mix well. Spread into the prepared 
pan and sprinkle with your choice of toppings. Cover the pan with foil.

Bake for 30 minutes covered, then uncover and bake 15 minutes more. 
Serve hot or warm.
