<h2>Bulgur Wheat</h2>

<pre>
2 cups medium-grind bulgur wheat
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
6 green onions, chopped
4 cups broth (chicken, etc.)
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon oregano

Brown the bulgur in a frying pan in the oil and butter. Add the green
onions, and cook for another moment. Place in a pan with the broth 
(you may use instant chiken broth). Season with a little salt, pepper 
and the oregano. Simmer for about 20 minutes just as you would rice.

Sauteeed mushrooms added to this dish are also good. Serve in place of
the bulk and boredom of potatoes.
