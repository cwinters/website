<h2>Lemon Bars</h2>

<p>I halved this recipe to fit into an 8’x8’ baking dish, this recipe will fit a 9’x13’ dish. Recipe c/o Cook’s Illustrated.

<pre>
The Crust:

1 ¾ cups flour
2/3 cups powdered sugar
¼ cup cornstarch
¾ tsp. salt
12 Tbs. unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter baking dish and line with one 
sheet of parchment. Dot paper with butter, then lay second sheet crosswise 
over it. This makes removal and cutting the bars much easier.

Pulse flour, sugar, cornstarch and salt in food processor. Add butter and 
process to blend, 8-10 seconds, then pulse until mixture is pale yellow
 and resembles coarse corn meal.

Sprinkle evenly into baking dish and press firmly with fingers into an even 
1/4 inch layer going up 1/2 an inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, 
then bake until golden, about 20 minutes.

The Filling:

4 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/3 cups granulated sugar
3 Tbs. flour
2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest
2/3 cup lemon juice (strained)
1/3 cup whole milk
1/8 tsp. salt

Meanwhile, whisk eggs, sugar, flour in medium bowl, then stir in lemon 
juice, zest, milk and salt to blend well.

To finish, reduce oven to 325 degrees. Stir filling to reblend and pour into 
warm crust. Bake until filling feels firm when touched lightly, about 20 minutes.

Cool to room temperature. Gently lift the bars using the edges of the parchment, 
it will easily pull away from the bars (or can easily be cut). Use a clean knife or 
pizza cutter for each slice for even neat bars.
