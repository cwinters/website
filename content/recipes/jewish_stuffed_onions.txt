<h2>Jewish Stuffed Onions</h2>

<pre>
8 large onions, peeled
1/2 pound beef or lamb (or veggie crumbles!)
1/4 teaspoon allspice, ground
1/4 teaspoon dill weed, dried
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
1 raw egg
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons olive oil
Juice of additional fresh lemon

Cut the onions in half, cutting across the onion, not from the bottom
to top, and scoop out the cores. Chop 3 tablespoons of the cores and
add to the meat, allspice, dill weed, lemon juice, parsley, salt,
pepper and egg. Fill the onions with this mixture, leaving a bit of
the meat overflowing from the top of the onion to form a crown. Dust
the meat tops with the flour and fry them, meat side down, in the oil
until just brown. Put the onion cores in another saucepan and add the
juice of the lemon and just enough water to cover this onion bed,
which will act as a steamer. Put the filled onions, meat side up, over
this bed. Simmer, covered, for about 1 hour or until the onions are
soft, adding water from time to time if the onion-core bed should
become too dry.
