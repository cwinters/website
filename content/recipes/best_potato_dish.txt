<h2>Best Potato Dish, Ever</h2>

<pre>
Gratin Dauphinois
2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, thinly sliced
3 1/2 cups of milk, cream or a mixture of the two
2     garlic cloves, minced
1     teaspoon salt
1/2   teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
a bit freshly grated nutmeg
3/4   cup coarsely grated Gruyère (or other cheese - any one will do).
</pre>

<p>Preheat oven to 400°F. Generously butter a shallow baking
dish.</p>

<p>Put the potatoes into pot with the milk or cream, garlic,
salt, and pepper and bring just to a boil. Pour the contents of
the pot into the buttered baking dish, grate the nutmeg over the
top and sprinkle on the cheese. Bake for about 45 minutes, until
the top is browned and all the liquid has been absorbed by the
potatoes. Allow this to stand for 15 minutes (or more) before
serving.</p>
