<h2>Southern Biscuits</h2>


<p>Yield: 1 dozen</p>

<p>Prep: 20 min</p>

<p>Cook: 20 min</p>

<pre>
Ingredients
------------------------------

* 2 cups flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons shortening
* 1 cup buttermilk, chilled


Directions
------------------------------

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda
and salt. Using your fingertips, rub butter and shortening into
dry ingredients until mixture looks like crumbs. (The faster the
better, you don't want the fats to melt.) Make a well in the
center and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir just until the
dough comes together. The dough will be very sticky.

Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently
fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. Press into a 1-inch thick
round. Cut out biscuits with a 2-inch cutter, being sure to push
straight down through the dough. Place biscuits on baking sheet
so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough, working it as little
as possible and continue cutting. (Biscuits from the second pass
will not be quite as light as those from the first, but hey,
that's life.)

Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20
minutes.
