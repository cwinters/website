<h2>Thai Fish Soup</h2>

<p>Here is the recipe for my Thai Fish Soup (pleast note that 
none of these measurements are in any way scientific, as I 
just improvise every time anyway)</p>

<pre>
1 Big Lump of Ginger
2 Cloves of Garlic
2 bay leaves
2 Chilli Peppers
1 Big Carrot
2 handfuls of Snow Peas
1 head of Bok Choi
1 can of Coconut Milk
250 ml Chicken Stock
1 good slug of Fish Sauce
Zest and juice of 2 limes
Fun little fishies (prawns, mussels, crab, etc)
Fine egg noodles

Roughly chop the Bok Choi and finely slice the carrot. Peel and 
grate both the ginger and the garlic. De-seed and chop the 
chilli. Add a slug of fish sauce in to a pan on a high heat 
with the garlic, ginger and chilli. When the smell starts to 
get really foul (as fish sauce boils it lets off a very 
pungent smell) pour in the coconut milk and add the bay 
leaves, lime zest and chicken stock. 

Bring the mixture to a  simmer, then add the rest of the 
ingredients. If you want to experiment do so here, and add 
whatever vegetables take your fancy. In the past I've added 
things like water chestnut, beansprouts, and bamboo shoots, but 
it doesn't really matter. Anyway, leave it to simmer for about 
10 minutes. In the meantime, pour boiling water over the egg 
noodles to soften them. When they are soft add a portion to a 
bowl and slop the fish soup over them.
