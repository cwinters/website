<h2>Cold Vegetables in Mustard Dressing</h2>

<pre>
2 tablespoons wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper to taste
1 egg at room temperature
1 tablespoon lemon juice
8 tablespoons olive oil
6 carrots, peeled and sliced
3 medium zucchini, sliced

Place the vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, egg and lemon juice in a
food blender and mix for 30 seconds. Slowly add the olive
oil. Refrigerate. (You will not need all this for the vegetables, so
you will have some left for a salad or two.)

Blanch the carrots for 10 minutes in boiling water; then add the
squash. Cook for another 5 minutes, drain, and refrigerate.

When the vegetables are cold, toss them with a bit dressing and serve
as a vegetable side dish.
