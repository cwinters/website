<h2>Garbanzo Salad</h2>

<pre>
1/2 pound garbanzos, soaked overnight, drained
1 green pepper, sliced
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 yellow onion, peeled and sliced thin
Chopped parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1/8 cup white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon basil
1/4 teaspoon oregano
Sugar, to taste

Cook the garbanzo in water to cover for 1 hour. Do not overcook: they
need to be firm but tender for the salad. Drain and chill.

Combine all ingredients and toss in steel bowl.

Allow the salad to marinate in the refrigerator for several hours
before serving it.
