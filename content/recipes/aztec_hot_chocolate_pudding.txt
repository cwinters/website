<h2>Recipe: Aztec Hot Chocolate Pudding</h2>

<p>Time: 45 minutes</p>

<pre>
Butter for greasing pudding dish
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Pinch of salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup superfine sugar
1/2 cup best-quality cocoa powder
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup corn oil
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup dark rum.

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 8-cup pudding or soufflé dish. 
Set aside. In large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, 
salt, cinnamon, chili, superfine sugar and  1/4 cup cocoa powder. In 
small bowl, mix milk, vanilla and oil. Pour into flour mixture. Mix by
hand for thick smooth batter.

2. Spoon batter into pudding dish, and smooth the top. Pour  3/8 cup 
water into a small pan. Set over high heat, and bring to boil. In 
small bowl, combine remaining  1/4 cup cocoa with brown sugar, making 
sure there are no lumps. Spread evenly across the batter. Pour boiling
water over it, and top with rum.

3. Bake pudding until top is a bubbling sponge and center is wobbly 
and liquid, about 30 minutes. To serve, spoon out portions that 
include some of the top and chocolate sauce beneath. If desired, 
accompany with vanilla ice cream.
