<h2>Tracey's "Get Fat Quick" Potato Casserole</h2>

<pre>
2 pounds frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1 can cream of chicken soup [Stockmann - Cream of Mushroom]
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
4oz butter, melted or softened
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 pint sour cream [kerma villi]
Bread crumbs (topping)

Mix all the above ingredients together in a 2 quart covered casserole dish,
sprinkle the top with bread crumbs. Bake for 1 hour at 350F.

hfb always adds extra onions and cheese and a little less butter. Garlic is an
excellent addition too.
