<h2>Vegetable Tagine</h2>

<p>A recipe for anyone who has complained that dishes designed for vegetarians don't have the flavor of meat dishes. In addition to a mixture of common spices, the essence of this tagine is provided by zaatar, a tangy blend of sesame, sumac, thyme and marjoram.</p>

<pre>
2 tablespoons butter or extra-virgin olive oil
2 medium onions, diced
2 fresh small chili peppers, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup dried lentils
4 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup tomato puree
1 cup chickpeas, cooked or canned (if canned, drain and rinse) 
1 cup carrot, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 1/2 cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 zucchini, cut into 1-inch dice
3/4 cup green peas, frozen
1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1 tablespoon zaatar (see note) 
Salt and pepper to taste.

1. In a medium or large saucepan over medium heat, warm the butter or oil. Add 
the onions and chilies and cook until the onions begin to soften, about 10 minutes.

2. Add the paprika, cayenne and cumin and continue to sauté until the onions are 
tender and fragrant, a few minutes longer.

3. Add the lentils, tomatoes, tomato puree and water just to cover. Simmer for about 
20 minutes.

4. Add the chickpeas, carrots, green beans, zucchini, and green peas. Simmer until 
tender, about 10 to 15 minutes more. Add the parsley and zaatar during the last 
five minute of cooking. Season to taste. Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve
immediately.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

Note: Zaatar can be purchased from Middle Eastern specialty stores or Kalustyan's, 
800-352-3451 or www.kalustyans.com. If you cannot find it, substitute an equal 
amount of a mix of ground sesame seeds and dried thyme.
