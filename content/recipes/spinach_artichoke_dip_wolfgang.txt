<h2>Spinach Artichoke Dip</h2>

<p>Who said dip has to be a trip back to the fifties and a bunch of canned ingredients blended with cream cheese? Creamy mascarpone, goat cheese and Parmesan combine with artichokes and spinach to make this fabulous party dip. All it needs is hot, crusty French bread as an accompaniment to make a great summer appetizer or hors d’oeuvre.</p>

<p>Makes about 2 cups, 4-6 servings</p>

<pre>
3 bunches spinach, washed, stems removed
1 10-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup mascarpone cheese
1/3 cup creme fraiche
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons goat cheese
2 tablespoons roasted garlic (see separate recipe)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Topping:
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons breadcrumbs
1/4 teaspoon paprika

1. In large metal sieve, blanch one bunch of spinach for about 1 
minute in large pot of boiling water. Transfer in sieve to bowl of 
iced water and leave for 30 seconds. Remove sieve from water and with 
the back of a large metal spoon drain out excess water. Set aside. 
Repeat with remaining bunches of spinach.

2. Place artichokes in bowl of food processor fitted with a steel 
blade. Process for about 5 to 7 seconds or until very coarsely 
chopped. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.

3. Add mayonnaise, mascarpone cheese, creme fraiche, Parmesan, goat 
cheese, roasted garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Process for 
another 5 seconds or until combined.

4. Add blanched spinach and process with on/off motion a few times or 
until well blended. The dip should still have some texture and not be 
completely smooth. Spoon into a shallow ovenproof dish.

5. In small bowl combine all ingredients for topping and sprinkle over
spinach dip. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for about 15 to 20 minutes 
or until heated through and top is golden brown.

Serve hot surrounded by slices of crispy French bread or crackers.
