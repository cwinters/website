<P><EM>cancelled, reruns on Court TV</EM></P>

<P>This is, without a doubt, my favorite drama on television. I almost broke
down and got cable in February because my reception sucks and I had to sit four
inches away from the television with my hand on an antenna adjusting knob to at
least make out the general scenery and the race of whomever was speaking.</P>

<P>The show is in repeats now and probably will be until September, unless NBC
foolishly decides to try and kill it again.
<A HREF="mailto:feist@lightingdesignalliance.com">Frank</A> thinks they've slipped a little
bit this season, that they don't have the edge they used to. I think the edge
has changed.</P>

<P>One of my favorite episodes played tonight. It opens up with Bayless and
Pembleton at a bowling alley, standing over a 13-year-old black child who'd been
shot twice behind the ear. Finding who did it isn't much of a problem: one of
the other kids readily identifies him, almost to the astonishment of the
detectives.</P>

<P>Next time we see them, they're finding the family of the boy who was shot.
The mother isn't home, and the child who is home informs them that, &quot;I
don't have a daddy.&quot; They take the boy to where the mother works; when they
tell her they are homicide detectives, her face breaks down. She starts sobbing
and says over and over, &quot;No, not Darryl&quot;</P>

<P>The detectives can do nothing to console her, but the camera stays around
for an extra five seconds anyway. There are no words spoken, no fierce
utterances that they're going to get the bastard who did this, who took this
pure, innocent young life. Just a mother crying and hugging her youngest to her
for fear he'll be gone too.</P>

<P>When Bayless and Pembleton are walking to the woman's house, we hear the
first sounds of a Belly song called, <EM>Full Moon, Empty Heart</EM>, one of my
favorites off the <STRONG>Star</STRONG> album. The song is the main reason I
remembered this episode so well, and I think it's the best such use of a song as
I've ever seen on television.</P>

<P>If you don't know the song, it starts off with a forlorn, &quot;Sleeping/down,
down&quot; then moves to a &quot;It's too loud.&quot; Very slow, just a few
guitar chords trailing off with the words. Then it starts kicking in, and that's
when they go hunting down the kid who killed Darryl.</P>

<P>They first go to his house, serving his mother with the warrant. All the
cops wear vests, counter to the Hollywood mentality that vests are uncomfortable
and are therefore only for wimps. They don't find him on the ground floor or
upstairs; Bayless goes upstairs and waits the proper suspense-building amount of
time (about 3-5 seconds) hugging the wall before turning rapidly, gun drawn,
into the hall. In his sights is a small boy, maybe eight years old. The boy
said, &quot;I needed my book.&quot; Bayless, exhausted from the adrenalin,
slumps against the wall and asks, &quot;You a good speller?&quot; The kid says, &quot;Yeah,&quot;
as he walks by and Bayless replies, &quot;I wasn't going to hurt you.&quot; &quot;Yeah
you were,&quot; the kid says, &quot;yeah you were.&quot; Belly is still in the
background.</P>

<P>Cut to them accompanied by some black-and-whites by a basketball game --
Belly still pumping, a little louder. Pembleton jumps out of the car and yells,
&quot;Ronnie!&quot; We see a kid hustle off into a dead end. He reaches in his
jacket and seems to toss something aside. But when he realizes he's cornered, he
pulls out a gun and points it straight at Pembleton. He points it sideways, like
Mel Gibson does sometimes in the Lethal Weapon movies. I'm not sure if that's
supposed to be an indicator of confidence, but it comes off like hollow bravado.</P>

<P>The kid yells, &quot;I ain't goin' with you!&quot; and keeps the gun leveled
at one of the group of cops. He then points it at his own head and you get one
of those moments Homicide is famous for, where there's a brief rush of sound and
the camera cuts back to the shot it had half a second before. They often use the
technique for when people face life-threatening situations or when people learn
something that is fundamentally shocking to them. Bayless tackles the kid and
everything's okay.</P>

<P>Again, there's no posturing by the cops, no slapping the kid around or
taunting him. They're professionals, particularly Pembleton, whose character is
so magnetic that it's not difficult to get sucked into his viewpoint, his way of
looking at the world. </P>

<P>(The show's creators sometimes have this problem also, and the few episodes
that show him outside the workplace or as a normal person -- such as the
excellent show that had Bruno Kirby as a vengeful ex-con earlier this season --
are then made that much more special for their rarity. The same can be said for
the other character I thoroughly enjoy on the show, Kay Howard.) </P>

<P>Eventually (I'm not going to describe the <EM>entire</EM> show here), the
mothers of the two boys meet at the police station, neither aware of the
horrible circumstances binding them. They talk about nothing in particular, and
you slowly realize that the big conflict you expect from such a confrontation is
never going to materialize. When the mother of the boy who killed the other
enters the corridor where the other mother already waits, I felt a terrible
tension that I get every time I realize there's going to be an unbearably
uncomfortable situation coming up. </P>

<P>But they are not the cariacatured women you see in movies -- the mother of
the boy who was killed is not paralyzed by her grief, requiring the help of a
herd of men to tear her away. And while the other mother slips into stereotype a
little, her heart isn't in it. You know she realizes her boy killed another and
you can see her reconciling the images she retains of his childhood with the
facts before her.</P>

<P>This is where Homicide excels. The show realizes that there is no sense to
be made of murder, of most crimes. Even if there is sense, it's so petty as to
be ridiculous. As any reader of News of the Weird can tell you, however, <EM>truth
is always stranger than fiction</EM>. The latest (April 96) Spy Magazine has a
section from Chuck Shepherd on stupid reasons people kill other people: because
they didn't agree that the officials were giving the Oakland Raiders bad calls;
because she changed TV channels without asking; because he disturbed the sock
drawer; because he stepped on a foot. Life is so sad. How can we take anything
seriously when people do things like this, when people will do anything to make
ten bucks over their commission, when people say they're right and you're wrong.</P>

<P> Why did Ronnie kill Darryl? Mistake, an error. Some other kid (&quot;Basil&quot;,
who must be the only one in the City of Baltimore) dissed Ronnie so Ronnie took
action. Only he popped the wrong kid. No matter, he explains to Pembleton in The
Box, &quot;People get killed in car accidents every day. How's that any
different?&quot;</P>

<P>Pembleton can only shake his head. What can you say to something like that?
What can you possibly say?</P>
