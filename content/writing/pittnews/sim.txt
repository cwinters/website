<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Cerebus: Aardvark adventure takes comic books into the 21st
century</H1>

<P><EM>by Chris Winters</EM></P>

<P>The half-life of a comic book can usually be measured in months; if it's
lucky, years. Even rarer is a comic book which knows precisely when it will
finish.</P>

<P><EM>Cerebus</EM> is slated to end in March 2004, a life of 27 years. Only
Dave Sim has written, drawn and published <EM>Cerebus</EM>, and he will be the
only person to do so until it is complete. Last weekend Sim visited Pittsburgh
as part of the U.S. '92 tour promoting <EM>Cerebus</EM>, attending a convention
on Sunday and signing issues at comic stores around the area on Friday and
Saturday.</P>

<P>Cerebus is an aardvark living in a Middle Ages framework who doesn't use
personal pronouns, and <EM>Cerebus</EM> is his life, more or less. Sim gets
somewhat exasperated when people ask him what <EM>Cerebus</EM> is about. &quot;If
I could say what Cerebus was about in five paragraphs, I wouldn't have done it
for 14 years. I wouldn't keep doing it for 12 more.&quot;</P>

<P>In 1977 Cerebus began as a mercenary got entangled in a bureaucracy to
become prime minister, quit after becoming frustrated with governmental
impotence. wound up a pawn of a powerful politician to be catapulted to Pope and
after riding a black tower to the moon, was Pope no more. This took roughly 110
issues. The comic then slowed down and dealt with more allegorical themes
(death, marriage, love).</P>

<P>Cerebus then became an unwanted houseguest and found himself battling an
entire church of militant feminists. <EM>Cerebus</EM> will end when Cerebus
dies, at issue 300.</P>

<P>Central in Sim's mind, and to <EM>Cerebus's</EM> uniqueness, is the idea
of a complex story from beginning to end. Most comics don't have a consistent
storyline in mind because the number of writers and artists who serve their time
each have their own vision. Instead, mainstream comics frequently rely on one
issue stories which  sell  comics (&quot;Appearing in this issue: The
Punisher/Ghost Rider/Spider-Man!&quot;) but are short on character development
and involved plots, terms people don't normally think apply to comics.</P>

<P>One of the obstacles Sim has had to overcome is the perception of comics as
kids' stuff. Neither people used to reading comics nor people new to comics were
used to the sometimes-wordless issue. Mike Rehn, a sometime Pitt graphic-arts
student, said Sim is &quot;Best whenever he keeps his verbosity to a minimum.&quot;</P>
<P>Sim himself explained the distinction between comics and fiction: &quot;A
visual literary medium is where you show what's going on rather than explaining
it.&quot;</P>

<P>At the Phantom of the Attic in Oakland, Sim's first stop last Saturday,
several  people nervously milled around 15 minutes before Sim's arrival. Half an
hour later, Sim's fans packed the store, and it remained so until he left.</P>

<P>For two hours, the calm, reddish-blond Sim stood behind the front desk and
shook hands with all the fans before signing their comics. Because there were so
many, there was not a chance for more than a few cursory thank yous (&quot;Great
work on the book&quot; &quot;Thanks for your support&quot;) until the next
person came up with a stack of books for Sim to grace with his signature and
perhaps a quick sketched head of the famed aardvark.</P>

<P>At the larger B.E.M. in Wikinsburg, Sim had a much smaller crowd and was
able to answer more involved questions about <EM>Cerebus</EM>.</P>

<P>He also expounded on subjects from television's influence on politics to the
conflicts between feminism and child rearing while doing sketches and sipping
Diet Coke.</P>

<P>Sim is outspoken on many issues. He is a fierce supporter of free-agency for
artists (&quot;Shouldn't it be the ideal of any individual to sell his services
to the highest bidder?&quot; he said) and is known in the comic world for his
brutal opinion of editors and large companies.</P>

<P>&quot;Business people don't like to touch artist people if they can help
it. That's why they hire editors,&quot; Sim said.</P>

<P>Cerebus, unlike many comic hooks, is not merchandised much beyond T-shirts.
(&quot;I don't mind  doing T-shirts,&quot; Sim said, &quot;because I wear
T-shirts.&quot;) Although he's had proposals for games (&quot;Nobody comes up
and says. 'I do lousy wargames, and I want to turn <EM>Cerebus</EM> into a
wargame.'&quot;) and an animated <EM>Cerebus</EM>, as well as offers from
larger comic companies to purchase <EM>Cerebus</EM>, Sim possesses a strong
desire to keep everything about Cerebus his, and he keeps everything in-house.</P>

<P>Arthur Allen, an employee of Phantom, says Sim's autonomy &quot;Lets him be
more frank because he doesn't have to answer to anyone but himself.</P>

<P>&quot;He isn't such a cog in the machine like Jim Lee and Todd McFarlane
(two popular artists from Marvel Comics).&quot;</P>

<P>Allen also pointed out Cerebus has been around longer than both companies
which distribute comics to the East coast.</P>

<P>One of Sim's main selling points -- to both distributors and retailers --
is that <EM>Cerebus</EM> has been around 14 years and will be around for 12
more.</P>

<P>It won't fade away like other independent comics.</P>

<P>Asked about the reason people not into comics are attracted to <EM>Cerebus</EM>.
Sim thought for a moment and replied, &quot;In this day and age, if you have
something you want to get published, you'd have to go to Tundra or be
distributed by Eclipse. Self-publishing is something we don't want to run out of
completely.&quot; </P>
