<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Expensive appearance = respect?</H1>

<P><EM>by Chris Winters</EM></P>

<P>Over the winter break I traveled to Chicago for a convention of the History
Honor Society. I learned quite a bit about Cyprus, Cossacks in Russian popular
culture and witchcraft from papers presented by students who were probably as
nervous as a teenager catching a glimpse of forbidden skin on Cinemax late at
night. But I learned more by walking around Chicago itself and seeing  how 
people looked at what was around them.</P>

<P>I strolled the streets dressed for a convention.  It wasn't an incredibly
slick suit, but it was a suit just the same.</P>

<P>I click-clacked along Michigan Avenue in my nice shoes which needed shining
but were still nice. My tie was calm, sedate, businesslike. I even have short
hair - the sort of person who doesn't cause trouble, a person who, when treated
right, might spend a sizable amount of money in these desperate retail times.
What other person would wear a suit?</P>

<P>People treat you differently when you're dressed nicely. Salespeople say &quot;please&quot;
and ~sir&quot; and make the extra effort.  If I went into a  certain  &quot;nice&quot;
bookstore (with piped-in classical music,) dressed in jeans, Chucks and a
T-shirt, it's doubtful that the clerk would have searched so diligently for a
novel I requested. Even my trip into McDonalds on Saturday morning was enhanced
by the ultra-quick service and the extra-wide smile of the high-school student
behind  the counter.</P>

<P>Those  on the street act differently as well. They are first to step out of
your way if that crowded-sidewalk confrontation arises; their eyes show respect,
and in turn you feel self-confident that nothing is wrong with your world.</P>

<P>You walk tall and smile, and even your smiles are taken differently - some
glance nervously away, and others glare back defiantly, daring you to repeat
your transgression. The suit is power. Businesspeople understand this. But what
kind of power is it?</P>

<P>A shallow power, I think, and another example of our need to continually
one-up each other. Think of it this way: What if you have a suit,  but  it's not
a very nice one     maybe a little old and ratty, maybe too snug in the wrong
places?</P>

<P>You're vulnerable. Someone with a tailor-fitted, Italian-named suit can
come along and exert a kind of subliminal authority over you - a clothing
authority. You won t realize the force of this authority until you're asked your
opinion on something, and you won t venture forth what you truly think because
of some nagging fear in the back of your mind that they'll laugh at you, not
take you seriously because you're lower on the suit chain than they. Until
you're tested by the system which created you, you'll never realize the
pervasiveness of its influence.</P>

<P>I call this power shallow because it doesn't mean anything; it's not based
on anything honest. Political power is derived from the electorate; a suit's
power crassly comes from the size of one's wallet.</P>

<P>Power should be derived from your ability to think, to persuade, to argue
-- not because you can buy sharp suits.</P>

<P>Maybe I'm overstating the influence of the suit.</P>

<P>There are still places in the world where ability counts for something,
places where less time is spent complaining about things like, oh, unfair trade
practices, and more time is spent making the best damned whatever that can be
made.</P>

<P>There must be.</P>

<P>And a lot depends on the environment as well. If I were to wear my suit
around campus, to classes, to my job in the library, I would get an awful lot of
stares as well as cause some people to believe I'm a hardcore Republican because
liberals, evidently, loosen their ties and let their tongues waggle.</P>

<P>I wonder what it means to be a doctor, sporting blue cotton and a
stethoscope all the time, plus those little booties they put over whatever shoes
they're wearing so as not to track in any nasty bacteria. I wonder, are there
designer hospital blues?</P>
