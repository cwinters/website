<P>Hysterical! I laughed through this entire movie. Stiller is great as a
well-meaning but emotionally impotent guy who latches onto finding his real
parents as the solution to all his problems. My response to Patricia Arquette
followed the same response I've had to other movies I've seen her in: I don't
like her in the beginning, but then she starts to grow on me. The subplot about
the two homosexual (or bisexual) BATF agents was great. Mary Tyler Moore and
George Segal are just perfect as the parents who actually raised Stiller, and
Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin equal them as Stiller's natural parents who have spent
the last 30 years tripping and making LSD. Genuinely funny movie without any of
the really disturbing stuff from &quot;Spanking the Monkey,&quot; Russell's
previous (and first) film. </P>
