<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Fugitive</H1>

<P><STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG></P>

<P>Man falsely accused to murder brings evildoers to light.</P>

<P><STRONG>Cast</STRONG></P>
<P>Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, Sela Ward, 
Jeroen Krabb&eacute; (slimy, as usual)

<P><STRONG>Director</STRONG></P>

<P>Andrew Davis</P>

<P>Tons of information from <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0106977">imdb</A></P>

<P><STRONG>Words</STRONG>

<P>One of the best action/suspense movies ever made. As an added bonus, it's
got a terrific <A HREF="/writing/movies/opening">opening sequence</A> and 
had a fantastic preview.</P>

<P>The story is ridiculously simple. First guy is convicted for murdering his
wife, escapes en route to prison and sleuths out who killed his wife. Second guy
looks for him. (Almost as simple as a movie I saw today, <EM>Broken Arrow</EM>:
first pilot steals nuclear weapons, second pilot gets them back.)</P>

<P>Complexity, however, does not make a film great. Look at <EM>Dune</EM>.
<EM>The Fugitive</EM> has got a top-notch action director, a perfectly paced
script, two rock-steady actors heading it up and a good supporting cast of
people.</P>

<P>What makes this movie great? It's very focused (not tangential); it teases you
slightly (marshal breaking into house: who's in there?) without being 
smartass or just plain annoying (see Sleeping with the Enemy); there's not a 
lot of idle chitchat (Ford goes through a big chunk of the movie without
saying a word); no annoying voiceovers; no explaination at the expense of
story. It's also very down to earth: nobody does anything really superhuman
that you'd say, "Yeah, right" and have to suspend your disbelief that 
it's just a person.</P>

<P>Jeroen Krabb&eacute; has got to get a new agent: the only film
I can think of him <STRONG>not</STRONG> being a bad guy is
<EM>Immortal Beloved</EM>. It makes things too predictable!</P>

<P>(more later)</P>
