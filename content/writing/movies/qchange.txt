<P>Quick Change is one of my absolute favorite comedies. It's not for everyone,
though. Quick Change is like a Monty Python movie: for some people its blend of
surrealism, slapstick and cleverness works marvelously; for some people, it's a
chore to sit through. I think you also have to like Bill Murray.</P>

<P>First, the premise for the robbery is very clever, and the film makes it
very believable. <STRONG>Of course</STRONG> the Chief of Police has more
important things to do than shepherd a few hostages, of course they'll get
ignored by the beat cop thrust into a situation. (There was one tiny hole,
although I'm not sure if it really exists: would the police trace calls made to
the hostage negotiator?) </P>

<P>Bill Murray played a perfect clown, and his repartee with the bank manager
is hysterical. After he goads Geena Davis into calling him a &quot;coward&quot;
and the rest of the hostages &quot;pussies&quot; the bank manager pipes up, &quot;Take
her out next. You don't need this kind of aggravation.&quot; (Later, the bank
manager is talking with Rottzinger, Chief of Police, and says the bank owes it
to the shareholders to to let the police shoulder all the bad press. Rottzinger
asks, &quot;How many shareholders are there?&quot; &quot;Just the three of them,&quot;
the bank manager says with a smile, offering his hand as goodbye.</P>

<P>There are a number of moments in this film that will always stick in my
mind, much like the Simpsons. When the trio see the bizarre jousting match,
between two hispanics on bicycles with dustpans lashed to broomsticks,
everything is perfect -- the timing, the music, the shot afterward of the
loser's bicycle rolling slowly toward the priest, who casts it aside as if it
were possessed, the young/old woman in the rocking chair with a cigarette
permanently perched between her first two fingers. Best of all, though, is
Loomis's line afterward. &quot;It's bad luck just seeing a thing like that,&quot;
he says. &quot;Just a couple of guys with some things to work out,&quot; Grimm
counters half-heartedly. They all know they stumbled on something they were
never supposed to see in the city, where mere blocks can seem like eons.</P>

<P>Other classic scenes:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Murray talking Phil Hartman out of shooting them with the ending line, &quot;I
don't judge you, really I don't. But from Woodstock... to Charles Bronson?&quot;
as their car's windshield is smashed by firemen who roll it down the hill and
into the park.</LI>
 <LI>Grimm and Loomis in the bathroom stall together making noises that sound
like Loomis is getting a blowjob and the other man in the bathroom's stunned
reaction, &quot;You freaks can keep this city!&quot;</LI>
 <LI>The middle eastern cab driver looking at Loomis with that blank stare,
saying that line that sets Loomis out the door and <EM>=smack=</EM> into the
newspaper stand.</LI>
 <LI>Loomis and the mob goon comparing their similar forehead wounds.</LI>
 <LI>The guy with the guitar who tries to get on the bus again, and again, and
again...</LI>
 <LI>Grimm's race to the bus as he tries to beat the mob, the cops, the cab
driver and the bus driver who must-keep-on-schedule. (Philip Bosco, who plays
the bus driver, is tremendous: &quot;I look back there every day, my friend. That
is why I keep my affairs in a clean and hygienic fashion.&quot;)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Anyway, see this movie if you haven't before. It is well worth your time.</P>
