<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>(This was the first article I wrote for CTR, and I didn't even really
write it, I adapted and restructured it from a <EM>much</EM> longer piece. I'm
not sure which is more difficult. Have you ever seen the Calvin and Hobbes strip
where Calvin is thinking up a new slogan for safety. Hobbes mentions that
Calvin's mom suggested (reasonably, his expression says), &quot;Look both ways
and you'll be safe each day&quot;  or something like that. Calvin makes a face
and says, &quot;I like mine better: 'Be careful or be roadkill.'&quot; He shows
the poster to Hobbes, who makes a gagging face, and Calvin asks, &quot;I ran out
of cadmium red.&quot; I thought we should scare the shit out of people with this
and include really gross graphics. All we did was stick a Biohazard sign in the
article. Oh well.)</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Unseen Danger of Bloodborne Pathogens</H1>

<P><EM>by Chris Winters</EM></P>
<P>A large part of community transportation's mission is getting people to and
from medical care. Dialysis patients are a significant section of these
important clients. However, transporting a dialysis patient can be tricky: a
tube can work loose and the patient can bleed on other passengers and the driver
before a professional can get it under control.</P>
<P> But what happens if the blood is infectious? Accidents will happen and nobody
can prevent them. But with strong foresight and a prevention strategy, transit
managers and employees can eliminate some of the unfortunate consequences from
such an accident. </P>

<H2>Danger: Infected Blood</H2>

<P>Bloodborne pathogens are viruses or other infectious agents carried by the
blood. Two particularly harmful examples are the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) and the virus for Hepatitis B. Deadly as they are, infections from these
bloodborne agents can be prevented. It takes a well thought-out plan for
training, constant attention to detail and a  mind set among employees and
managers geared toward eliminating risk.</P>
<P> The consequences of poor planning can be disastrous. An employee who becomes
infected from a bloodborne pathogen can sue the transit operator for huge
amounts, charging insufficient equipment and training. Even if the employee
settles and the system has insurance, the legal costs can cripple a small
system. And if the system doesn't have insurance, such a lawsuit spells the end.</P>

<P> Help does exist. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has
written a regulation to help organizations protect their employees from
on-the-job exposure to blood or other bodily fluids. Following the regulations'
guidelines can provide a formal defense should an infection occur and the
inevitable lawsuit follow. (Managers should, of course, obtain specific advice
from legal counsel.)</P>
<P> The OSHA regulation's plan for safety can be divided into four parts:</P>

<UL> 
<LI>Vaccinate employees who might be exposed</LI>  
<LI>Train employees who might be exposed</LI>  
<LI>Supply employees with necessary materials</LI>  
<LI>Implement exposure procedures</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Vaccination Key to Prevention</H2>

<P>First, a manager needs to determine which employees need vaccinations. A key
question is: in which jobs could people be exposed to infectious disease? This
group of jobs includes not only drivers whose potential exposure is daily but
also those employees who face occasional exposure.</P>

<P>The manager must ensure that all medical evaluations and procedures involving
the vaccination and follow-up are free to all employees, available at a
reasonable time and accessible place and performed by a licensed health care
professional.</P>

<P>Ensuring that employees are vaccinated can be a difficult process. For example,
the vaccine for Hepatitis B is actually a series of three injections: the second
shot is given 30 days after the first and the third shot five months after that.
A manager needs to keep track of when the employees have their shots to confirm
they follow through the entire procedure.</P>

<P>Once the vaccination is complete, a manager must keep a record of the time and
place of the vaccination series. If an employee declines the vaccination for
Hepatitis B, a manager must keep on file a written statement signed by the
employee, the language for which is specified in the OSHA regulation.</P>

<H2>Continuous Training is Critical</H2>

<P>Training is an integral part of eliminating the risks of bloodborne
pathogens. The OSHA regulation specifies a number of characteristics the
training must fulfill:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Frequency: Training should take place as soon as an employee is hired or
shifted to a position where exposure may occur. Training should be refreshed at
least annually thereafter.</LI>  
<LI>Content: The content and vocabulary of the training should be
understandable to employees. The program should include a copy of the OSHA
regulation, explanation of bloodborne diseases and symptoms, explanation of how
diseases can be transmitted, information on emergency procedures to follow and
information on incident reporting and medical follow-up procedures.</LI>
</OL>

<P>OSHA specifies that a manager must keep for three years detailed records
about the content of the training and the dates the training sessions were
given.</P>

<H2>In Case of Incident</H2>

<P>The OSHA regulation requires that employees be provided with appropriate
protective equipment and materials. Having a comprehensive biohazard kit aboard
all vehicles can help prevent infection from bloodborne pathogens. Items
appropriate for a biohazard kit include  disposable latex or vinyl gloves, paper
towels, disinfectant spray effective on HIV and the tuberculosis virus, orange
plastic trash bags for disposing biohazardous material at a medical disposal
facility, face masks, eye protectors such as goggles, antiseptic hand wipes and
a leakproof sealable container for any needles found.</P>

<P>If the biohazard bags are used to clean up a spill or other incident, it is
imperative that they be disposed of properly. Managers or employees should let a
local hospital or health clinic handle the disposal since they already have a
system in place for it.</P>

<H2>Handling an Incident</H2>

<P>Even with every precaution in place, an employee may still be exposed to
bloodborne pathogens. In that case, the manager is required to:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Document how the employee was exposed.</LI>  
<LI>Identify the patient who bled and document any history of disease. This
includes testing his/her blood as soon as feasible. If the patient refuses to
provide blood for testing, the manager must document the refusal.</LI>  
<LI>Inform the employee of the patient's test results. While the employee has
a legal right to know the patient's test status, the results must remain
strictly confidential.</LI>  
<LI>Test the exposed employee for HIV and Hepatitis B and provide
counseling to the employee if necessary.</LI>  
<LI>Enlist the services of a health care professional to recommend
appropriate actions to protect the employee's health. The professional's
report must be provided to the employee within 15 days, and the manager
must retain a copy of the report for 30 years. </LI>
</UL>

<H2>Other Sources of Information</H2>

<P>This is a formidable laundry list of what needs to be done to protect both
employees and clients. While it  will take some time to accomplish, meeting the
OSHA regulations does not have to be as daunting a task as it first seems. Help
is available. The Community Transportation Hotline -- (800) 527-8279 -- has
information on bloodborne pathogens. </P>

<P> For more guidance, you can purchase a copy of the publication <EM>Managing
Bloodborne Pathogens: Guidelines For Transit Managers</EM> from
<A HREF="http://www.infi/net/~waltcon">Walther Consultancy</A>. OSHA can
provide a sample Exposure Control Plan, but it will be one developed for a
medical facility and thus not transit-specific.</P>

<P> Developing a proper and complete program for preventing biohazard exposure is
essential to protect the health of employees and riders.  But there is no need
to do it alone or from scratch.  Take advantage of the available assistance
options and the task will be much easier.</P>
