<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Big Fairways</H1>

<P>My father tilted his head and craned it toward the windshield, peeking at
the bloated grey sky. &quot;Think it's going to rain?&quot; he asked for the
third time.</P>

<P>&quot;Don't think so. Wouldn't be quite fair, would it? Besides, if it were
going to rain it would go ahead and do it instead of threatening all day, right?&quot;
He nodded with slightly more certainty this time. I felt odd, grown up,
reassuring my father this way. But golf meant a lot to him. Since his own father
died young, my dad thought himself shouldering the necessity of tradition.</P>

<P>We pulled onto the base through a back entrance so we didn't have to bother
with the MPs out front. When I was a kid, I would always salute them from the
back seat when they gave their own go-ahead salute. They never appreciated it,
and when I grew up I didn't blame them. A salute is a serious thing, and there I
was, mocking it. Well, not really mocking; to truly mock something, you need to
really understand it.</P>

<P>My dad steered the compact around some leafy curves he could have traveled
blindfolded. Since he retired, he played two or three times a week, even this
late into the fall. I'd just finished graduate school and played once a year, at
our annual family reunion where I hit enough sweet, wonderful shots to wonder if
I should take this nutty thing up but enough horrible, embarrassing ones to know
better.</P>

<P>But today he really wanted me to go with him, so I went. We pulled into the
lot and he slipped into his spikes, rasping over the asphalt toward the
clubhouse. He nabbed a few tokens and we hit range balls until I felt loose
enough to trust myself with the real thing.</P>

<P>Our turn came up for a full 18 and we were paired with two near-40 guys.
Cocky. Maybe former pilots? They sized up the situation in about ten seconds and
after introductions one of them motioned for me to tee off first. If I gave a
shit it would be a little dig, since you allow the weakest person to shoot first
on the assumption that he'll win no holes and thus gain no honors to shoot first
on later holes.</P>

<P>&quot;Flat greens,&quot; one called after me. There was an awkward pause,
then my dad said, &quot;Big fairways.&quot; I suppose it was some sort of
ritual, a &quot;Break a leg&quot; for the clubby scene. &quot;Big fairways,&quot;
I nodded,  grabbed the driver and walked up to the blue bulbs that indicated
where the merely human men lined up. (Non-human men &#151; gorillas &#151; lined
up at the yellow bulbs about five yards back and to the left, women lined up
about twenty yards ahead at the red bulbs.) I made the ball and tee kiss, jammed
them into the ground, jerked up a little to give me some room.</P>

<P>I held the driver upright, head to the sky, and surveyed the area. Aluminum
storage sheds 30 yards ahead and way off to the right, a gold Mercedes sedan
parked between them, clubhouse ten yards behind me and the same distance to the
right. The other three of my group, dad standing slightly separate, five paces
behind and just to the right. Ten behind them, a few tables with oldtimer
curmudgeons watching everything, everyone through squinty eyes under floppy
fishing hats.. Bastards. I could care less about shanking one in front of my
dad; and our accompanying twosome would see me do that enough the rest of the
afternoon. But them?</P>

<P>I tried to stick a song in my head to relax. &quot;Maybelline,&quot; by
Chuck Berry usually worked. Chuck clicking (&quot;why can't you be true?&quot;),
I stepped to the ball.</P>

<P>Head down, I thought. Head down, relax, back slow, relax. Settled my feet as
if burrowing a pad in sand, shook my butt a few times and put the driver's head
an inch from the ball. Drew back, nothing in my head, reached out and smacked
the ball with no feeling. Perfect.</P>

<P>Billionth of a second later, the loudest crash I'd ever heard reverberated
for eternity over the driving range beyond the aluminum sheds, one of which I'd
just put a huge dent in. &quot;Fuck me,&quot; I muttered, forehead in hand. I
should have known they'd be magnetic.</P>

<P>My dad took a step toward me, thought the better of it and said, &quot;Just
go ahead and hit another ball.&quot; I nodded, looking back at the table of
coots. Their barely stifled giggles tickled my nose like a stranded dandelion
seed.</P>

<P>I rushed the next one, anxious to just make it go straight and out of the
eyes of outsiders. Same result, although I'd now made mark on both sheds, this
one nearest the car. One of the oldtimers couldn't contain himself: &quot;Hey,
that's a Mercedes,&quot; he blurted out before he broke down in cackles with his
buddies.</P>

<P>Dad just gave me a look. Don't do it again, it said, through whatever passes
for a look's gritted teeth. I was embarrassing him. Imagine how he felt, trying
to hand this silly game down to me, full of its noble traditions and cautious
rules, and all I could do was abuse the lawn equipment.</P>

<P>I wondered if I could hit the Mercedes on purpose. Serve those people right.
Why'd they park it there, anyway? They deliberately put it in danger just so
their friends could see what a great car it was, how successful they were.
Probably the same guys who bragged about their titanium drivers and laser
precision honed wedges.</P>

<P>Right then, that Mercedes looked as big as a 18-wheeler. I smiled to myself,
opened up my stance toward the gold monstrosity and readied myself to cut loose
right at it. Fuck the price.</P>

<P>My mind as clear as a singsong stream, I reached back with the club, up up
up, and came down as fast and hard as I could. My hands, my arms, felt no
contact, only the sweet satisfaction of a rocket launched from my body. </P>

<P>I held on for the gratifying window crash, but none came. Nothing at all.</P>

<P>My dad broke the silence with a, &quot;All right! That's the way to do it!&quot;
and the wrinkled has-beens started clapping. I looked up the fairway to see my
ball settling to grass, bounding with one huge bounce after another. Right up
the middle.</P>

<P>Dad clapped me on the back. &quot;See?&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing to it.&quot;
He looked down at my feet, then over at the car that had been spared my mercy. &quot;Sometimes,&quot;
he said, &quot;you never know where the thing is going to end up.&quot;</P>

<P>I nodded. &quot;Probably a good thing, too.&quot; I hoisted my bag on my
shoulder, slid the driver in and turned to watch my father try and beat my shot.</P>
