<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Things I Wrote</H1>

<P>I've liked to write since I was a boy about yay high. In fact, my first
published work came in the 3rd Grade -- an epic called &quot;Harry the Hero&quot;
for which I created both words and  pictures. (Stick figures don't go over as
well today, though.) Harry, of course, saved lots of people from a burning
building. Everybody loved him. They laminated the story and, presumably, still
have it in the library at Jackson Park Elementary School in Bremerton,
Washington, filed under &quot;Undesirables.&quot;</P>

<P>Since then, I've turned my sights to more earthly tasks.</P>
