<p>Trolley riders:
<br />
Exit at the <b>Kelton</b> trolley stop; walk to the end of the
platform away from the city (so the houses are on your left) then keep
going to the next street, Alabama. We're at 1529, about six houses on
the left.</p>

<p>Driving from downtown:
<br/>
1. Find a way to get onto the Liberty Bridge. Skip to 3.</p>


<p>Driving from points east:
<br />
2. From the Parkway (376), take the Boulevard of the Allies exit, also
marked Liberty Bridge. From there, stay in the LEFT lane to exit to
Liberty Bridge/South Hills.</p>

<p>3. On the bridge get in the LEFT lane and continue straight through
the tunnel. Continue on West Liberty Avenue for ~2 miles.</p>

<p>4. At Alabama Ave. turn RIGHT.</p>

<p>5. Cross Dell Ave. and the trolley tracks. We're about six houses
on the LEFT at 1529. You can only park on the left-hand side of the
street but there's usually something there or at the bottom of the
hill to the right.
