<h1>That is a problem</h1>

<p><em>Scene: The morning after Anne's sleepover at the breakfast
table.</em></p>

<p>Me: I heard Benjamin was sick. Is he feeling better?</p>

<p>Anne: I don't know. <em>(pause)</em> Yeah, he's feeling
better.[1]</p>

<p>Ella: Did he go to the doctor Anne?</p>

<p>Anne: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ella: Did he get a sticker?</p>

<p>Anne: No</p>

<p>Ella: Oh. That's a problem.[2]</p>

<p>[1] "I don't know" seems to be the toddler default answer if
one isn't on the tip of the tongue. This is a frequent type of
exchange with Ella: "Do you remember what kind of car she has?"
"Yeah." "What color was it?" "I don't know." "What color was the
car?" "Umm... blue." "Right!"</p>

<p>[2] Said in the tone of someone just told that the production
line capacity is down 20%.</p>
