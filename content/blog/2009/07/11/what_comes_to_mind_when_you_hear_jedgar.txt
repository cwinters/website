<p>Ella picked up a new series at the library the other day, "My
Bedbugs". It's one of Ella's first recommendations, given to her
by a boy who was climbing the bookshelves as he gave it. (Do
that, Ebert!)</p>

<p>It's got a weird vibe, but as usual the songs are catchier
than they deserve. (Isn't there a limited supply of catchiness?)
There's an odd character who watches over the bugs, scolding them
in an English accent, named 'J. Edgar'.</p>

<p>I scoffed when I first heard that, figuring the writers were
attempting some adult hooks by naming the dictator after an
infamous director of the FBI. After watching I realized I was
giving them too much credit: J. Edgar is a talking vacuum, of the
Hoover variety.</p>
