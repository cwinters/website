<h1>Careful how you name things...</h1>

<p>I ran into this quote while getting at least newbie-familiar
with Kerberos, since it's used as one of the security
underpinnings of many transactions within the 
<a href="http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/">IHE Technical
Framework</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Doug Rickard wrote to explain how Bones got its name.  In 1988,
he was working at MIT, with the Athena group. He was trying to
get permission from the State Department to export Kerberos to
Bond University in Australia. The State Department wouldn't allow
it -- not with DES included. To get it out of the country, they had
to not only remove all calls to DES routines, but all comments
and textual references to them as well, so that (superficially,
at least) it was non-trivial to determine where the calls were
originally placed.
<br /><br />
To strip out all the DES calls and garbage, John Kohl wrote a
program called <tt>piranha</tt>. At one of their progress meetings, Doug
jokingly said, "And we are left with nothing but the Bones."
For lack of a better term, he then used the word "Bones" and
"boned" in the meeting minutes to distinguish between the DES
and non-DES versions of Kerberos. "It somehow stuck," he says,
"and I have been ashamed of it ever since."

<p>Many people (especially at the beginning of a project) have
probably had this experience of not knowing the long-term effects
of even the most trivial choices they're making. Here's a boring
one of mine.</p>

<p>In Vocollect products you can made the wearable computer issue
a <b>beep</b> to the user, specifying the frequency and
length. One time you do this is when you're waiting for something
to happen -- data to come back from the network, whatever. While
working on a prototype to read RFID tags I needed to indicate
when we were busy reading tags, and I used a particular frequency
and length for the beep so I could distinguish it from the
standard ones. And my boss said, "Be careful. If this is
successful thousands of warehouse workers around the world will
hear this beep for years to come, and you don't want them
cursing your name."</p>
