<h1>QCon 2009: Architecture Reviews</h1>

<p>Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</p>

<ul>
<li>Writer, reviewer of many different types of arch</li>
<li>How can you present your own arch well?</li>
</ul>

<p>To explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>what is your design? why is it good?</li>
<li>why did you make certain design decisions?</li>
</ul>

<p>"Collaborate" definitions:</p>

<ol>
<li>work together, joint effort</li>
<li>cooporate treasonably
<ul>
<li>which group will you be presenting to? what subgroups might
there be? you MUST be aware of this, because strategy
varies a lot</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>"Illusion of transparency" -- geeks are bad b/c we assume people
know what's in our head, how we got to the conclusions we did;</p>

<ul>
<li>works the other way too: bad at assuming we know what
someone else is thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>"In-group bias" -- if you're in my tribe you get  afree pass</p>

<p>Book "Software Systems Architecture" by Rozonski et al; how to
present architecture (nb: RWB thinks it's too defensive)</p>

<ul>
<li>Decision</li>
<li>Constraints</li>
<li>Alternatives: what you considered and ruled out</li>
<li>Effects: what does decision imply</li>
<li>Evidence: here's why it's good
<ul>
<li>Leaves them on high note...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, proactive, explaining + constructive; idea and goal is
to open up discussion</p>

<ul>
<li>Design idea</li>
<li>Requirements</li>
<li>Positives</li>
<li>Negatives</li>
<li>Limitations</li>
<li>Design notes</li>
<li>Issues, uncertainties</li>
</ul>

<p>On giving advice: "triage" mentality focuses effort; don't focus
on stuff that's irretrievably broken, or just on slightly
scratched items</p>

<p>Key findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendations</strong>: feel really strongly about</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions</strong>: useful, but not wed to them</li>
<li><strong>Observations</strong>: might lead you to other conclusions not
necessarily explicit</li>
<li>Ground all in facts as much as possible</li>
<li>Be sure to comment on good ideas/decisions too! Gives you cred</li>
<li>Scale the review to the size and criticality of the project,
and whether it's early or late in the process</li>
</ul>

<p>Agile has architectural impacts</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it support automation of acceptance tests</li>
<li>How can domain rules be encoded to be testable? </li>
<li>Ease of configuring? Reconfiguring?</li>
<li>Delivered and deployed incrementally?</li>
</ul>

<p>Develop features (tracer bullets) that touch multiple parts of
the system so you can exercise</p>

<p>Beware the technical stack; watch out for people who focus on
low level technical elegance; (CMW: I am... occasionally guilty
of this)</p>

<p>Merging existing systems (like product lines) is REALLY hard!</p>

<ul>
<li>hidden requirements in developer heads, code</li>
<li>what's your migration strategy?</li>
</ul>

<p>(CMW: this is like large scale, deep context switching)</p>

<p>Risks compound: do not underestimate; even if no single risk is
big the cumulative effect can be huge.</p>

<p>Ensure right people are involved. Sometimes tribes don't talk,
or are unsure of trade-offs. </p>

<p>Questions for reviewers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can focus some questions for different reviewers, along
with some for all. </li>
<li>Are your questions yes/no? (aka, open/closed) do they lead
to discussion or decision? (which do you want?)
<ul>
<li>gives columbo example here, funny visualizations in my
head...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some other types of questions:
<ul>
<li>evaluation (how good do you think...?)</li>
<li>accuracy (how did you come up with numbers...?)</li>
<li>completeness (is that all...?)</li>
<li>relevance (does this apply...?)</li>
<li>purpose (why did you suggest...?)</li>
<li>extension (tell me more about...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No response in meeting? How long to wait? Bob Powers says
"count to 9..."</li>
<li>Clarifying questions:
<ul>
<li>why do you say that...?</li>
<li>what exactly do you mean by...?</li>
<li>how does this relate to...?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Handling criticism, different types:</p>

<ul>
<li>valid/invalid</li>
<li>aesthetics</li>
<li>judgemental</li>
<li>complexity</li>
<li>personal</li>
<li>"great!" (code for: "they didn't really look at it...")</li>
</ul>

<p>(she has a paper on her website about criticism types)</p>

<p>Disagreement hierarchy: paulgraham.com/disagree.html</p>

<p>People make decisions based on what they remember! (not some
objective evaluation of truth) So what will they remember of your
presentation?</p>

<ul>
<li>People remember what they hear first and what they see
last.</li>
<li>People cannot avoid compariing things to one another,
vs a fixed standard.</li>
<li>To be persuaded, we listen, compare, reconcile, ...</li>
</ul>
