<h1>Java validation framework in JavaScript?</h1>

<p>It seems that being able to do client-side and server-side
validation with the exact same code (plus extension points for
implementation details) is a Good Thing. So is there a framework
out there where I can write my validation rules in JavaScript and
execute them either in the browser or on the server-side? My
searches didn't find any, but using 'javascript validation' in
your search brings in a lot of chaff.</p>
