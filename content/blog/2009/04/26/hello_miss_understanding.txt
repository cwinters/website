<p>This is mildly embarrassing, but I've been misunderstanding a
common slang phrase for as long as I've known it. The phrase is
"butterface," which is a rude way of referring to a woman with a
nice body but a not-so-nice face. (Not sure what the male
equivalent is.)</p>

<p>I'd thought it was making some comparison to actual butter --
does that mean she's greasy? Or mushy? Or that she goes well with
toast? Every once in a while I'd hear it on the radio and went
over the possibilities in my head, but in the end, I figured it
was a reference to some pop culture thing that I just didn't get,
being on the custom of old-dudeness.</p>

<p>The other night we went out to get ice cream, and Barb
mentioned some woman with a cute body. The woman walked past and
(being a good husband) said, "You're much cuter than her. She's a
butterface."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Someone who has a nice body but not a great face. I don't
quite get what it means, how a face is like butter..."</p>

<p>She started laughing, "But her face, get it?"</p>

<p>"Oh... yeah," I said sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Now you have something to blog about," she said.</p>
