<h1>My hair isn't that bad</h1>

<p>A colleague last week:</p>

<blockquote>Colleague: Did you get your hair cut?</blockquote>

<p>(She said it as if a 'finally' was between 'you' and 'get',
which was well deserved.)</p>

<blockquote>Me: Yeah, I needed it.</blockquote>

<p>...pause...</p>

<blockquote>Colleague: Did you get it cut at the
mall?</blockquote>

<p>Ouch! Even worse: she wasn't trying to be snarky.</p>
