<h1>Ease up on coding horror</h1>

<p>I've been meaning to post this for a while, but <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8fgf4/dear_fellow_rubyists_or_how_to_repel_women_from/c096h3q">this
mention of Jeff Atwood being annoying</a> brought it back onto
the radar.</p>

<p>Jeff and his site <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a> have
been maligned as "script kiddie", "never done anything worthy of
respect", and probably lots of other awful things that people
would never say face-to-face. (And those are both from <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/798ss/whats_with_all_the_coding_horror_hate/">one
set of comments</a>!)</p>

<p>I had similar opinions (though not so rude or boorish) for a
while. But I later had a few realizations that brought me around
to Jeff's side.</p>

<p>First, after dropping off the blogging map for a while I have
a much deeper appreciation for the amount of effort it takes to
keep a blog going. It's relatively easy to write on the set of
ten or twenty topics that you start with. But to publish
non-trivial articles, week-in and week-out, shows real discipline
and desire. And one of the things I've grown to understand over
time (even before reading <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/">Outliers</a>)
is the value of discipline over intelligence/talent.[1] In one of the few
<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/writing/pittnews/sim.html">interviews
I've done</a> I wasn't able to include Sim's thoughts on people
hiting him up to publish their comic. He said something along the
lines of (going through his side of the dialogue), "This looks
nice. What else do you have? Oh, a few full-page drawings? Tell
you what, go home and do a fully penciled, inked, colored and
worded page a day for two months, then call me back." Nobody ever
did. Doing anything creative on a regular basis is
<b>hard</b>.</p>

<p>Put another way: it's easy to bitch from the cheap seats that
something is dumb or simple. Fine, where's your output? Oh, you
don't have time? Or you have a few drafts that aren't quite ready
to publish because of your high standards? Yeah, thought so.</p>

<p>Second: When you write there's pressure to always have
something new to say. But Jeff ignores that.[2] That's not to say he just
copy-and-pastes other peoples' work. Instead, he looks at the things he
does in his daily work or play and writes about them in his own
voice. Is it "new" that 
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000803.html">running
an antivirus program slows down your machine</a>? Or making
concrete some of the benefits of multiple cores? Of course not,
technical hardware sites have done this stuff (dryly) for ages. But
following through with numbers (along with how they're gathered,
also useful), collecting information from other sites around the
internet and weaving them into a narrative is
<b>valuable</b>.</p>

<p>Third: the dude has a thick skin. In the typical net fashion
people talk as if they know him and malign his work and
personality, spewing out bile that you know would never be vented
in the real world, face to face. Me? I'd probably get sick of the
bastards after a while, tell everyone to go pound sand and close
up shop. But he keeps chugging along, banging out short items 
<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror">on twitter</a> and long
blog posts.</p>

<p>Finally: you'd barely know from his output he's got a new
infant in the house. I was just able to keep up with my day job
and have an occasional adult conversation with my wife for the
first month or two after Ella came, much less actually write
something in my spare time.</p>

<p>I don't agree with everything he says, and his
Windows-centrism can get annoying (particularly when it's
combined with ignorant Java-negativism), but I appreciate his
work for what it is and hope he's able to keep it up.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>[1] Don't willfully misinterpret this to mean that I think
Jeff is stupid.</p>

<p>[2] And rightly so, in my opinion. People wind up either not
publishing because they think they don't have anything original
to say, or saying something 'edgy' but stupid because it has to
be original. There are very few people doing anything
original. Most of us are working on the same shit as everyone
else, with minor variations. You are not a unique snowflake.</p>
