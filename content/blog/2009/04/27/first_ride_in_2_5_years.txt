<h1>First ride in 2.5 years</h1>

<p>Yesterday I took my first bike ride in over 2.5 years. There
were a number of uncertainties going in: </p>

<ul>

  <li>I had a new pair of shoes along with new cleats, picked up
  in anticipation of riding in 2007 that never happened. I
  remember having a little trouble getting used to the 
  <a href="http://www.mtbr.com/cat/drivetrain/pedal/time/atac-xe/PRD_415783_135crx.aspx">clipless pedals</a> 
  and my muscle memory for getting in and out was
  gone. So I anticipated at least one tip-over where I'd need to
  stop but forget to twist my heel.</li>

  <li>My bike had been in the basement for the whole time; what
  crud had it accumulated? Would the tubes and tires be in good
  shape?</li>

  <li>Physically, I've been exercising fairly regularly since
  early February. But running on a treadmill and riding a
  sit-down exercise bike is very different than being in the real
  world.</li>

  <li>Stuff I didn't know I didn't know.</li>

</ul>

<p>I went on my normal path of the 
<a href="http://www.montourtrail.org/">Montour Trail</a>. 
Typically I'll get on just off the Montour Run exit from the
Parkway, but the Parkway was closed this weekend from 79
westbound, so instead I drove up to Coraopolis.</p>

<p>One thing I'd forgotten was that the trail goes slowly but
steadily uphill. I used the <a
href="http://mytracks.appspot.com/">My Tracks</a> application on
my phone to plot the course; it told me the elevation change from
start to midway was about 350 meters. Fortnately, that means that
the ride back was downhill.</p>

<p>Another thing I'd forgotten was how to downshift!
Seriously. I'd only ridden this bike a handful of times after I
got it in 2006, and it's the first road bike I've had. Eventually
I figured out that moving the brake lever inward (for the rear
gear) downshifted. Dumb.</p>

<p>I wound up covering nearly 22 miles in 1.75 hours. Not a great
pace, but better than I expected. No tip-overs. And physically
things were okay, though I'm a little sore the next day. But it's
a good sore, like a "my muscles are there" sore, vs. a "I don't
want to move" one.</p>
