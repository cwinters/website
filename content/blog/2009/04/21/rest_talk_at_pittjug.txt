<h1>REST talk at PittJUG tonight</h1>

<p>I'll be talking tonight at the Pittsburgh Java Users Group on
REST, giving examples in Jersey. 
(<a href="http://webportal.pghtech.org/Events/CalendarEventsListView.aspx">See
invite</a> 
if you want to come but haven't signed up yet.) As with most talks I spent too
much time reading and thinking in preparation and not enough on
the talk itself. It probably suffers from too much content, but I
have no problem skipping over sections that people don't find
interesting.</p>

<p>Slides, my dorky little sample application, and a bunch of
links I found useful will be 
<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/rest/">posted later today</a>.</p>

<p>If you attend the talk and want to give me public feedback,
this is as good a place as any to do it.</p>
