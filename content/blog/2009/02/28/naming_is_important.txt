<h1>Naming is important</h1>

<p>A recent post on a mailing list pointed me to a <a
href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/27/whiners-that-fail"
title="Whiners that fail">rant by Uncle Bob on ingrate
developers</a>. He's responding to comments on a 
<a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/26/10-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice"
title="10 Papers every Programmer should read at least twice">blog entry 
from Michael Feathers</a> on classic recommended reading
material.</p>

<p>I'm going to use this to whine about a longstanding
irritation: people who don't name their documents
appropriately. If you click on the link for "Programming as an
Experience: The Inspiration for Self" you'll go to:</p>

<p align="center">
  <tt>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.562</tt>
</p>

<p>Not exactly a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URI</a>, is it?
If you click on the 'Download PDF' link you'll get a popup from
your browser asking if you'd like to save the document using the
name:</p>

<p align="center">
<tt>10.1.1.31.562.pdf</tt>
</p>

<p>Compare that to the URL for "On the Criteria to be Used in
Decomposing Systems into Modules":</p>

<p align="center">
  <tt>http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/parnas-criteria.html</tt>
</p>

<p>The awful document names are typically generated by content
management systems, where some brilliant developer decided to use
what's likely an internal, meaningless but unique identifier
because, you know, someone might want to download the entire
library to a single directory.</p>

<p>This isn't limited to naming on the web. Take applying for a
job. How many times do you as a resume reviewer get an email with
attachments named like this?</p>

<p align="center">
  <tt>resume.pdf</tt><br />
  <tt>cover letter.doc</tt>
</p>

<p>This is even more irritating than the CMS-generated
one. With the CMS someone ceded the decision when the system was
built and likely left the customer whose documents are being
served no choice. With the resume the person who created the
document is being the bonehead. And on top of that, the whole
point of a resume is to sell yourself! Even before I've opened
the thing you've annoyed me.</p>

<p>Left for another time: bitching about naming classes and
variables, and the usefulness of tools that allow you to change
these names reliably across a large codedbase.</p>
