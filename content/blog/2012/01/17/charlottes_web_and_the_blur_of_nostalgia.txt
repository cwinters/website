<h1>Charlotte's Web and the blur of nostalgia</h1>

<p>Without forethought I've seen three versions of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte's_Web">Charlotte's Web</a> 
in the last few months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413895/">live-action 2006 movie</a>,</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/">animated 1973 film</a>, and</li>
  <li>The recent <a href="http://trustarts.culturaldistrict.org/production/29602">Pittsburgh
  Childrens Theater production</a> (I won't talk about this one
  though: it was okay and fun for Ella)</li>
</ol>

<p>This all happened after 
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cwinters/status/81900557199089664">reading
the book to Ella</a> for the first time this summer. While it was
one of my favorite books as a kid I never really thought about
why that was so . Re-reading it with Ella brought it into new light: it's
direct and doesn't talk down to kids or sugarcoat death or pain
or rejection or heartbreak. But it moves on from those things as
well. It's also remarkably free of self-awareness, unlike a lot
of modern kids media.</p>

<p>So when Ella said she wanted to watch the movie, I figured
she'd seen something about the animated version somewhere. Which
I thought was fine: I didn't remember it very well, but I had a
vague feeling of nostalgia around it.</p>

<p>But when I heard it was a recent production, and had a CG
spider with Julia Roberts doing the voice, I feared the worst:
lots of singing and probably dancing, cute animals, pop culture
references for the adults, and maybe Charlotte wouldn't even
die. Grumble gumble. Surely it wouldn't be as faithful as the
barely remembered version from my youth?</p>

<p>So when we watched it that nagging feeling of nostalgia pulled me
into playing an internal cranky old man monologue for a while
("Julia Roberts doesn't sound right", "That guy was a jerk-off in
Rising Sun", "Where did those crows come from?"). But
then... then I stopped, and it worked. Really well. And I got why
the crows were there. And the CG was good but spare. And just
about everything that was great about the book was in the movie,
including the most important part: the tone.</p>

<p>My sister got Ella the animated verion for Christmas. And when
she visited over New Year's we all sat down to watch it. I was
keenly interested in how much better it would be than the new
version.</p>

<p>And it wasn't. At all. In fact, it was much worse. Lots of
singing, very little character development, almost no tension
between the characters at all. And there was a modern feeling
adult-oriented camp having 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lynde">Paul Lynde</a> 
voice Templeton. It added a layer of snark without much
else. Nostalgia lied to me, and I'm glad I was able to see
through it.</p>

<p>So, here are a few more reasons why the new version is much
better than the old:</p>

<p>The biggest one: why did Charlotte do this for Wilbur? 
   <br />
   <i>Old version:</i> Who knows? She comes up with the idea so
   soon after meeting him that it seems she was bored and looking
   for a project.
   <br />
   <i>New:</i> They took time to establish the friendship between
   Wilbur and Charlotte (just them talking, really) and,
   crucially, made Charlotte an object of disgust among the
   other animals. The idea that Wilbur's exuberance (for life in
   general and for Charlotte in particular) wins over the other
   animals and make her an equal to them is central. It gives
   reason and weight to her decision to go to the fair, which the
   movie brings out explicitly when (I think) one of the cows
   tells her she can't do it because of her babies.</p>

<p>Charlotte's appearance in the two is instructive as well. In
the animated version she's almost elegant: like a bug who's got a
classy hat on. But in the new version she's... well, gross. All
her eyes are looking at you and she's got bits sticking out here
and pincers chomping there. And over time, just like for the
animals, that falls away for you, and you see her swaying in the
breeze, weaving and talking to herself. Or gathering the animals
together for a pow-wow, or telling Wilbur she can't make it back
to the barn, and it's her voice that rivets you. (Sorry I doubted
you Julia.)</p>

<p>Templeton in the new version is more complicated. In the old
version he protests when asked to do something, but it's so weak
and short that you know he's still going to do it. In the new one
you're not really sure. Actual tension. Plus I think Steve
Buscemi was the perfect voice.</p>

<p>The old version has a dumb, completely unproductive
relationship between Wilbur and the 'runt' of the geese, who had
such an annoyingly cute name that I've wiped it from my brain. In
its place the new version brought out the characters of the
pompous sheep (especially Samuel -- John Cleese), the dumb but
faithful horse (Robert Redford), and the wise slow cows (Kathy
Bates and Reba McIntyre).</p>

<p>Fern's development gets short shrift in the old version. In
the new one she not only spends more time at the barn, but how
her mother reacts to her is played out more. (Beau Bridges makes
a brief but great appearance as the wise country doctor.)  Her
worries about Fern being antisocial/tomboy are carried forward
later in her surprise that she's wearing a dress to the
fair. This idea that kids grow up while you're worrying about
them is one that I think resonates pretty powerfully with
parents.</p>

<p>There's a voice-over line -- Sam Sheppard, nice! -- after the
fair and when the winter comes about a spring pig seeing snow for
the first time. Hugely poignant, completely missing from the
animated.</p>

<p>I didn't like how present Henry Fussy was in the old one -- they
tried to introduce a "mom's keeping him away" theme, then he went
away for a while to his grandfather's and came back more
"natural". In the new one it's much more subtle, a hint here and
there and then at the fair he's got a ticket for her to ride on
the ferris wheel. Smooth operator.</p>

<p>And when the new movie deviated from the book it did so in
elegant ways. The two crows (
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White">Elwyn and Brooks</a>, 
nice homage) provided comic relief, Ella loved them. Even now
whenever we see a crow we caw and say, "Corn!" </p>
