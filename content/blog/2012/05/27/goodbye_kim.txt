<p>On Tuesday my sister Kim collapased at Pittsburgh Airport. The
cause turned out to be a massive hemorrhage in her brain
stem. She never regained consciousness.</p>

<p>With such a diagnosis there's very little that can be
done. But with her age (she would have been 41 in September) the
staff performed a number of minor activities to give her every
chance to recover. But nothing changed her state, no recognition
but no pain or discomfort.</p>

<p>On Thursday, after being tested for viability of organ
donation, we had her breathing tube removed and after a short
while she died peacefully with my dad, stepmother, and me by her
side.</p>

<p>Kim was going home after visiting us for a few days, timed to
catch Ella's dance recital on Saturday. You can see from most of
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/tags/kim/">my
recent photos</a> of her plain and special love for Ella, and
she got on a plane whenever possible to come see her. While this
was an incredible shock, we'll always be grateful for the chance
we had to spend time with her before it happened.</p>

<p>There will be a memorial service in the Tampa area, but I
don't know yet when. It will likely happen at her workplace,
which has reached out with deep compassion and offers of
help. Her job put her with people all over the world, both
physically (Manilla and Mexico City) and virtually, and they're
all grieving.</p>

<p>Goodbye Kim. We'll miss you terribly.</p>
