<p>Last night after I read to Ella in bed and turned out her
light she asked me a question, "Dad, how did the mommy know what
the littlest bear was afraid of?" (She occasionally dips back
into books she was into years ago, this one was <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Youre-All-Favorites-Sam-McBratney/dp/076362442X">You're
All My Favorites</a> where the three baby bears are each afraid
their parents won't love them the best because of some
'deficiency'.)</p>

<p>I said, "Parents know a lot about their kids, even if the
kids don't know it. Mommy and I know a lot about you. That's part
of our job."</p>

<p>She yawned, closed her eyes, and said, "That's one thing I never
have to worry about." </p>

<p>"What's that?" I said.</p>

<p>"You and mommy not loving me."</p>
