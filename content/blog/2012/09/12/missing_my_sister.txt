<p>Today Kim would've turned 41. I would've teased her about
another year over 40, "it's all downhill from here" and other
expected small talk. I would've asked her what she was doing
today and she'd respond: "Going out to sushi with Crystal" and
then "I'm driving up to Dad's this weekend."</p>

<p>And I'd get Ella on the phone so we could sing "Happy
Birthday" to her. Kim would ask Ella about kindergarten, and
about her trip to Kennywood and riding the roller coasters for
the first time, and the latest Magic Tree House book she's read,
and princesses and jewelry and other girl things.</p>

<p>But none of that is going to happen, because she's gone.</p>

<p>So instead we'll go out for sushi this evening and talk about
Aunt Kim and how much we miss her. And, inside, I'll get a little
mad at her again for not taking care of herself better and
leaving us. And I'll steel that resolve to keep going to the gym,
keep riding my bike, keep leaving a little food behind.</p>

<p>And then, late tonight, I'll think about us growing up and how
we always had each other -- through my dad being gone on cruise,
and moving all the time to new schools and new neighborhoods and
new kids. And just soak in memory for a little while, even though
they're ringed with sadness. Because that's what we have.</p>
