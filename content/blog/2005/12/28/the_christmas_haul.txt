<h1>The Christmas haul</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.digicraft.com.au/calendars/">Classic Computer Calendar</a>, which Barb said is probably the geekiest thing I own.</li>
  <li>Couple of work shirts (one with pink!), winter gloves, slippers (which I actually needed)</li>
  <li>Media: David Sedaris CD, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNZU/qid=1135777903/">The 40 Year-Old Virgin</a> (which Kim and I saw when it came out, and it exceeded modest expectations and was actually very sweet), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156031442">Animals in Translation</a> by Temple Grandin</li>
  <li>Set of towels from my dad and stepmother, which are unusual because <b>our first names are on them</b> which immediately aged me 10 years, and it would have been 20 if it were only our initials</li>
</ul>

<p>(I only call it "haul" in remembrance of childhood Christmases since we don't buy much stuff now...)</p>
