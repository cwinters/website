Some people may call you cynical<br>and elitist but this doesn't matter to you. You<br>don't depend on other people's opinions to<br>determine how you live your life. You are<br>generally cautious and prefer to weigh the<br>consequences before you act. In conflicts you<br>prefer to remain neutral and aloof. You value<br>intelligence and you are a natural diplomat,<br>you can convince people to do what you want<br>them to do. Your weakness is that you sometimes<br>think more with your head than with your heart<br>and it leads to isolation. With the<br>intelligence of a Ravenclaw and the subtlety of<br>a Slytherin you will be sure to achieve all<br>your goals!
