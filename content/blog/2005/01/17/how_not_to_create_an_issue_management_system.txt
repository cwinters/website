<h1>How not to create an issue management system</h1>

<p>We're in the process of moving to a new issue management system at
work. Our old Access-based one was written in-house and is quite...
clunky. (I'm not supposed to say that because I'll step on someone's
toes. But if I write piece-of-shit software I'd rather someone tell me
so I can fix it rather than pretend everything is ok.) </p>

<p>Anyway, the new system is <a
href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearquest/">Rational
ClearQuest</a>.[1] We've gone through some sort of process to settle
on this software with a committee and meetings and such. (I'm sure
information about it is on the internal wiki but I'm not interested.)
And our project is the pilot for it so all our new issues will be
entered into ClearQuest and hopefully our feedback will help shape the
future direction of the product.</p>

<p>As the pilot team we needed a demo and overview of the system and
late last week we got it. But keep in mind that in the best blogging
tradition I haven't actually <b>used</b> the system yet. My
opinions here are based on notes I took during the demo and conversations
we had during and after it.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> The standard interface is a Win32 client rather than a web
browser. (This is almost a deal-breaker for me.) Plus, it looks like ass -- probably why they don't have many screenshots on the website...

<p>Apparently there's
some sort of web portal but we didn't see that. According to <a
href="http://www3.software.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rational/web/datasheets/version6/clearcase.pdf">the
datasheet</a> CQ web access works with IE, Mozilla and Safari (!), so it
might be okay but given the state of the Win32 client I'm extremely
skeptical. I'm also unsure how much pain the IT department is willing
to bear to deploy it, particularly if it depends on WebSphere...</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Searching is case-sensitive. So if you look for a project
'mercury' you won't find 'Mercury'. Jesus, how can someone design something like that in this day and age? (Another potential deal-breaker.)</p>

<p><b>3.</b> There's no 'search' box. Instead you have to create a query (using
another awful interface) or reuse queries that you or someone else
have stored for later use. And there's no way to just jump to issue
number N without using queries. Again, another straw on the
deal-breaker camel's back.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The client doesn't seem to use standard Windows GUI
controls. So you can't type in dropdown boxes and quickly navigate the
list of items. Since a number of the dropdowns have tons of possible
values navigation slows to a crawl. I hate Windows applications anyway, so this just makes it even more painful.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> File attachments seem to be stored in the database rather
than a filesystem. And given typical BLOB issues we were given a general
"don't use too many attachments" warning. Yeah, it's not like people need that or anything...

<p>Much to the developers'
surprise though, the Win32 client sent the file to the right
application when we asked it to 'Open' one of them.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> There are a ton of labels that are obviously just slightly-cleaned
variable names, if not direct variables. (This may be a customization
issue.) So you'll see things like 'Is_Issue_Foo_or_Bar' on a form or a
directive to change to the 'To_investigation' state.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> I don't think you can create a printable version of an issue or a
query without Crystal Reports installed. But I could be wrong about
that.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> There's no screen with all information about an issue in one
place. Just a dialog with about 10 tabs. While I guess tabs have been
used to good effect somewhere they're generally just terrible, especially when
all the tabs deal with different data attached to a single
record.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> There don't seem to be any shortcuts for commonly used data. For
instance, in a number of places you're asked to reference a product,
and the product includes version numbers so you'll have 'Mercury
1.00', 'Mercury 1.01', 'Mercury 1.02' as separate entries. Since many
developers are working on the next version of the software it would
make a lot of sense to have a 'Mercury LATEST' so you never even have
to think about it.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> The client exposes you to data and relationships you
don't need to see. This is a gigantic usability problem and IMO the
problem with many user interfaces because it makes the common case
really hard. (All software should subscribe to: "Make easy things easy
and hard things possible.") There are so many ways this manifested
itself but I only jotted down a couple.</p>

<p>Here's one example: when entering an issue you have to create the
issue (title, description plus some additional data) and then
associate it with one or more "change requests". Your issue might
touch several different products (or versions) and each one of these
gets a change request. Makes sense from a data management standpoint,
no problem. But the steps I have to take to create an issue are (from
memory):</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>enter a title and description
 
  <li>click the tab for change requests (it's red, indicating it
  requires data)</li>
 
  <li>click 'Create' to create a new change request</li>
 
  <li>in the new window that pops up, fill in data to three or four
  tabs, one or two of which have the above-mentioned issues with
  dropdowns so it takes twice as long as it should</li>
 
  <li>click 'Apply', which closes the change request window</li>
 
  <li>click 'Apply' for the original issue since it's associated with
  the change request just created (even worse: if I click 'Cancel'
  here instead of 'Apply', the change request is now an orphan!)</li>
 
</ul>

<p>Hey, I've got a great idea: I want people to enter solid issue
reports so I can fix and improve my software the best way possible. So
I'll create a system which drives them to absolute rage when they
enter issues!</p>

<p>More examples on this, just with identfiers:</p>
  
<ul>
  
  <li>The IDs for issues and change requests look totally
  different. The former are fairly reasonable (like '2015' or
  something), but the latter are just awful, looking something like
  'vfDB0000007'. And that's <b>supposed</b> to be a user-facing
  number!</p>
 
  <li>The user sees a number of identifiers that don't mean
  anything. When viewing an issue record you're given the standard
  Access control at the bottom of the page to navigate
  backward/forward to other records, and an ID is displayed there. But
  it's really long (10 digits or so) and isn't used anywhere else.</li>
 
</ul>

<p>Finally, one thing to keep in mind is that ClearQuest seems more
like a toolkit than a finished system and many of these problems might be fixed
with further customization. If they are I'd be happy to post about
this again.</p>

<p>[1] Sorry <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> folks: I would have recommended JIRA in a
heartbeat, but I had no say in this. One of the hazards of working for
a larger company is that you'll probably have less of a say in the
company-wide tools you use.</p>
