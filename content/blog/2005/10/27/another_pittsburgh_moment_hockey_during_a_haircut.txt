<h1>Another Pittsburgh moment: hockey during a haircut</h1>

<p>I got my haircut at the Pittsburgh Hair Company in Dormont today, my usual place. It's close (walking distance), cheap, and the women there are pleasantly chatty. Usually the conversation is about the weather, vacations, kids, local happenings. But today it was hockey -- rhapsodizing about Crosby's passing ("It's even more amazing when you see it for real") and why Fleury's butterfly-style of goaltending is preferred, why the line of Foo, Bar and Baz will gel soon, and so on.</p>

<p>And I was the only guy in the place and don't know squat about hockey. Cool.</p>

<p>(Actually, this is probably just a 'generic northeast city moment', but whatever...)</p>
