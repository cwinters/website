<h1>'An unknown illness...'</h1>

<p>An eerie shiver ran through me when I saw this snippet:</p>

</p>

<p>This is how those science fiction/horror stories always start, isn't it? Maybe it's like <b>The Stand</b> and those six people happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time -- truck stop/rest area/tollbooth when an escapee of a secret biological research lab bursts in and covers them in lab-created viruses. Or maybe these six hikers happened on the decaying carcass of a bear where a newly mutated virus is hanging out. Or something.</p>

<p>(It turned out to be a respiratory illness in a nursing home, but still. Brrrr.)</p>
