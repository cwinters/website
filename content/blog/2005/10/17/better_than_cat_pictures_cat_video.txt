<h1>Better than cat pictures: cat video</h1>

<p>A few weeks ago I tried out the movie capture feature on my camera on the default photo subject: one of our cats. So click on the photo for a 34-second silent movie of La Choy cleaning herself. My favorite part is about two-thirds through when she stares off in the distance for a couple seconds, then remembers what she was doing and continues cleaning. Because, you know, she's got a lot on her mind...
