<h1>iCurve is pretty useful</h1>

<p>Last week I received an <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve/">iCurve</a> I'd ordered from <a href="http://www.smalldog.com/">Small Dog</a>. Impression? Quite useful, even though the side-ports on the AlBook mean you can't set it flush with your monitor:</p>

<p>It's sturdier than it looks and the danger of the Powerbook sliding off without substantial help is exceedingly slim. But all the fuss about its appealing shape is kind of baffling -- unless you're at eye-level it's almost all hidden.</p>

<p>But that's okay -- well-designed stuff is always appreciated.</p>
