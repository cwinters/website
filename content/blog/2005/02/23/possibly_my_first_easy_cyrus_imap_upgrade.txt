<h1>Possibly my first easy Cyrus IMAP upgrade...</h1>

Hooray! I had to upgrade cyrus due to a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200502-29.xml">security issue</a>. My past experiences have been <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/search/?keywords=cyrus">terrible-to-fair</a> and I've been very hesitant to upgrade cyrus for that reason. But this one was as smooth as silk.

<p><em>Crowd: why don't you just kick cyrus to the curb?</em></p>

<p>It may have quirks but they're <b>known</b> quirks. Anything dealing with email servers has the potential to cause massive pain (ask <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/004382.html">Casey</a>) and where cyrus can do so I've already developed calluses.</p>
