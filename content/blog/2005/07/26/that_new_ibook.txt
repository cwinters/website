<h1>That new iBook...</h1>

The updated 12" iBook looks pretty sharp for the dough: $1000 gets you 1.3 Ghz, 512 MB, Airport + Bluetooth and DVD + CD writing. The resolution isn't great (1024x768) and the video is a little skimpy (32 MB, and OSX loves the video RAM), but very nice, very competitive.
