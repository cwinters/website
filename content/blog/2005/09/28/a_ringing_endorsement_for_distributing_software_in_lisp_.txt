<h1>A ringing endorsement for distributing software in LISP </h1>

<p>From <a href="http://dub.washington.edu/denim/research/">DENIM and SILK - Research</a>:

<blockquote>SILK is written in Common Lisp and runs on top of the Garnet system. Considering the resources Garnet requires and the need for Common Lisp on any client machine, it is difficult to release SILK to the public.</blockquote>
