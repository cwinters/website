<h1>Wow, a whole month...</h1>

I hate to be a blogging stereotype, but I didn't realize it was <b>quite</b> that long since my last post. I've kinda had the blahs for six weeks or so, I just didn't want to do any computer-type stuff at home. I've got shamefully late book chapters to review, I haven't been answering even personal emails, I have a huge queue of stuff building up for OpenInteract2, and so on. But I just didn't feel like doing any of it -- my apologies to people who are awaiting emails, notifications, etc.

<p>Even worse, I couldn't even imagine a state in the future where I felt like doing it. That's never happened to me before, at least not for such a long period of time. I was still doing some other stuff -- work around the house (photos coming soon), going to Perlmonger meetings, cooking every night. Part of it might have been some anxiety related to my new job (which I've been doing PT for the last 4 weeks or so), but I think it was also that I did a whole bunch of OI2 work at home in March and early April. The "undertime" discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932633439/">Peopleware</a> isn't just for work...</p>

<p>The one exception is that I've started learning C by plowing through the 2nd edition of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131103628/">K & R book</a>, even doing the exercises as I go. (I rarely do that with technical books, no patience/attention span.) It's not that difficult but such a step backward from how I normally think about developing software. One good thing is that I'll be using this at work so the learning shouldn't atrophy too much.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a few other things to post but I figured I'd just get this out of the way.... More soon.</p>
