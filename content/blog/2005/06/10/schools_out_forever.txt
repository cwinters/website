<h1>School's out for-ever</h1>

Today's the last day of teaching for Barb! I haven't written about her plans before because I know her sneaky students read my blog and I didn't want to give them anything to talk about. (Suckers!) She's starting a tutoring business called "My Personal English Teacher" for one-on-one work with middle-school-age and up students, particularly focused on writing. Fortunately the ETS played right into our hands by adding an essay portion to the SAT.

<p>Initially she was worried about getting enough clients but I wasn't too concerned. She's a great teacher and many of the parents (and other teachers) think she's fabulous. And since she's taught at a religious private school she's hooked into a tight-knit community. As a result she's already got a number of clients without doing any advertising or anything, just word-of-mouth. I suspect it'll continue that way.</p>

<p><i>Yes, we already have the domain, but the <a href="http://www.mypersonalenglishteacher.com/">website</a> isn't so fabulous yet....</i></p>
