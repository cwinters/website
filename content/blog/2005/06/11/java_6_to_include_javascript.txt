<h1>Java 6 to include JavaScript?</h1>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/blog/2005_06.html#000058">David Flannagan</a>, it appears so:</p>

<blockquote>The detail that is most interesting to me is that the JSR-233 (Scripting for the Java Platform) implementation will be included in build 40 (in a week or two, I think). And, it will include the Rhino JavaScript engine! So every Java 6.0 application will automatically have an embedded JavaScript interpreter.</blockquote>

<p>This is fantastic! I've now built two products at work that rely heavily on embedded JavaScript (also using Rhino). It's a great way to expose functionality dynamically. And a likely side-benefit of this is better documentation: nice.</p>
