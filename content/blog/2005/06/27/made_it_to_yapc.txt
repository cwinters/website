<h1>Made it to YAPC</h1>

<p>After some hefty delays my wife, mother-in-law, me and the car made it up to <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC</a>. The drive was fairly uneventful -- fairly hot most of the way up, and we were a little disapponted that we didn't get stamps on our passports. (My mother-in-law doesn't have a passport and she got a notarized copy of her birth certificate just for this trip even!) But if we didn't have everything with us they would have checked, right?</p>

<p>This is the first YAPC since 2000 I've been to that I'm not giving a talk. It's much, much more relaxing... More soon.</p>
