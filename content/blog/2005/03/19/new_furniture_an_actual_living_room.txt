<h1>New furniture: an actual living room?</h1>

Barb picked up some furniture last week at a going out of business sale. (You'll notice that on <a href="http://www.wickesfurniture.com/locations/">this location map</a> Pennsylvania isn't even on there anymore.) Some of the furniture at this particular location had been damaged in <a href="http://www.kruckewitt.com/">last fall's floods</a> but a lot of it was in good shape, including the two mission-y tables and a lamp as seen below. (Apparently the longer table is called a "sofa table" since it fits in behind the sofa.) It's definitely a step up from Ikea...
