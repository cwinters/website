<h1>Hyperproductive, then not so much...</h1>

<p>Over the years I've seen a number of programmers talk about bursts
of productivity. And those are just fantastic -- everything flows and
just fits. But then... it's gone, and that you had such a flow just
highlights the times when you don't. (<em>Doctor</em>: Why do you keep
smacking your head with the hammer? <em>Patient</em>: It feels so good
when I stop!)</p>

<p>So why can't I be like this all the time? Is it just that I have a
limited pool of smarts? Or do I only have sufficient smarts to solve a
problem after churning for a long time then bursting out the result
superfast. (Like how cats sleep all the time...)
<a href="http://mark.denovich.org/">Mark</a> and I have joked about this
before: "You lazy bastard, you're just sitting around reading Fark and
bloglines!" "No, I'm tending to long running threads working on a few hairy
problems."</p>

<p>Or maybe I just need to always have challenging problems to work
on? (That would be the most emotionally satisfying answer: it's not
that I'm lazy, I'm just not challenged!)  But: if I were really smart,
wouldn't I just figure out how to <b>make</b> the boring stuff
challenging?</p>
