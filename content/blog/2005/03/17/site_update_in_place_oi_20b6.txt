<p>Update went ok although with a few hiccups. Eating my own dogfood found a fairly serious bug in upgrading which should be fixed shortly. All the <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3344">REST</a> and <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3342">action resolver</a> stuff I talked about recently is now in action and you can now use preformatted text in comments with use.perl-inspired ecode tags -- thanks to <a href="http://use.perl.org/~aristotle/">Aristotle</a> for the suggestion.</p>

<p>I also added a new feature found in the updated 'news' package -- the front page and main news page now have an 'Archive' box listing all my news posts by month. Caching makes doing this dynamically a piece of cake -- it only gets generated once an hour, which makes my soon-to-get-more-memory server a happy camper.</p>

<p>So once I'm certain the aforementioned bug is fixed I'll get this version out on CPAN -- lots of changes, and for once it's on schedule. (Sure, it's a schedule I <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6681857&forum_id=3222">announced</a> only a few weeks ago, but you gotta have some victories...)</p>
