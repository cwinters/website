<h1>Recommendations for things to see between Monterey and Vegas?</h1>

In mid-August we're going to a wedding in Las Vegas. (Note to self: make sure we RSVP'd...) We figured since that's only 500+ miles from Monterey we should see <a href="http://fetalpositions.blogspot.com/">Kitty</a>, Mike and the new baby. (Well, I guess he won't be quite so new in August. But he'll be new to us!) So we're flying to San Jose a week earlier than the wedding and renting a car.

<p>After we've annoyed them for a few days we'll take a few days to drive down to Las Vegas. Any ideas on what to see in between? (Suggestions to "hang out in Death Valley" filed to <tt>/dev/null</tt>...)</p>
