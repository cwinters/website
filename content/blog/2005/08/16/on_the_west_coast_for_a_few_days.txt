<h1>On the west coast for a few days</h1>

Of course, I forgot to post this before we left, but yesterday we flew out to San Jose and drove down to <a href="http://fetalpositions.blogspot.com/">Kitty</a> and Mike's place in Pacific Grove. We'll be here for a couple days, then drive out to Sequoia National Park and amble around for a bit. Then we meander down to Las Vegas for a wedding over the weekend. Lots of photos should follow...
