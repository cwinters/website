<h1>A few simple p4 notes</h1>

<p>This is for the next time I open-for-edit in p4 a bunch of files before going out of town:</p>
  
<pre class="sourceCode">
# show all filenames opened for edit on the client with
# <b>different</b> content than what's in the depot
$ p4 diff -sa
 
# show all filenames opened for edit on the client with
# <b>identical</b> content as what's in the depot
$ p4 diff -sr
</pre>
 
<p>I like 'svn status' more (particularly since it works offline), but this is better than a stick in the eye. In theory I could do better with Perforce's <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/p4p.html">proxy</a> (run a local server on your machine then sync the servers) or maybe <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> (which works with SVN and P4), but I haven't got enough tuits for the stuff already on my plate...</p>
