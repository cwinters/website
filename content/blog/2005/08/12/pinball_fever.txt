<h1>Pinball fever!</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.papa.org/">Professional Amateur Pinball Association</a> is in Pittsburgh through this weekend. If you dig pinball even a little I highly recommend a visit -- there are a ton of machines that aren't dedicated to tournament play so you can just drop by, get some quarters and lose yourself for a while.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Perlmongers visited last night and had us some fun. Unfortunately traffic was horrendous and I missed most of Dan's presentation, but we did get to talk about the possible Pittsburgh Perl Workshop for about a year from now (More on that in the next few weeks...)</p>

<p>Fellow South Hills resident <a href="http://community.moertel.com/ss/space/">Tom</a> brought his camera and took some <a href="http://community.moertel.com/~thor/papa8/">nice shots</a>, including <a href="http://community.moertel.com/~thor/papa8/img_0633.jpg">this one</a> of yours truly showing <b>Diner</b> who's the man. (I got about six free games off it last night and I'll make a Namath-like prediction that more are on the way.) Tom and I were both bummed that they didn't have our old favorite <b>Sorcerer</b> -- I played this at least a hundred times my freshman year of college since it was in the dorm basement.</p>

<p>My time with pinball goes back quite a ways -- I bowled a lot (with brief pauses for moving and such) from when I was about eight until about the last year of high school. As night follows day, that means I I also played a <b>lot</b> of pinball. So my nostalgia was running deep as I recognized a lot of the machines there; what struck me most of all was how simple most of the games were -- my feelings were more tied to the artwork and my age at the time rather than the gameplay. Normal, I guess.</p>

<p>(<b>Not</b> normal is the state of my wrists and forearms after banging on Diner (and others) for a few hours -- ouch!)</p>

<p>(Regarding the title: I was trying to think of a clever phrase mixing Pittsburgh and Pinball but none of them sounded right. So in the absence of cleverness insert reference to the 70s!)</p>
