<h1>Bonjour is magic!</h1>

<p>A while ago we picked up a Brother 5440CN (printer/fax/scanner) for Barb's tutoring business. I didn't do much research beforehand, but it had a $30 rebate! And last week my trusty Okidata laser printer died so it was time to see how difficult it would be to hook up the Brother to the network.</p>

<p>It has both ethernet and USB interfaces, so I plugged it into the router and followed the instructions for Windows. Followed the directions and while there was no autodiscovery it was pretty easy.</p>

<p>Later, Barb wanted to print from my Powerbook and I figured if XP could hook into it, surely OS X could. So I fired up the printer configuration screen and clicked add, figuring I'd have to plugin the IP address.</p>

<p>But it just showed up! I didn't know the printer came with Bonjour (aka Rendezvous, aka Zeroconf). I still had to grab the driver from the Brother website but it just worked.</p>

<p>BTW, why is it that printers need new drivers? Don't we know enough about printing technology by this point to make a handful of driver classes per manufacturer and allow the printer to advertise itself as belonging to one of them?</p>
