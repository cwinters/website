<h1>Getting paid from open source</h1>

<p>This is nice when it happens: a client needs LDAP
functionality for
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> <b>right now</b>, is willing to pay for it
<b>and</b> is willing for the work to be distributed with
SPOPS under
the same license. Sweet.

<p>The (slight) downside is dealing with LDAP -- I
understand it and
can work with it no problem, but I always feel like there's
something
I'm missing.

<p>One of the other benefits (sorta) of writing code on a
contract
basis for a short deadline is testing -- people want to know
that the
code works, and the best way to do it is testing. IMO it's
easier to
skip over testing when the people using the code are peers
than when
someone has paid you money for a particular thing to work.
So since I
was adding new features to it the SPOPS tie interface (along
with its
subclass that does strict field checking) now has decent test
scripts. Hooray for <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Test-More">Test::More</a>!

<p>We went camping this weekend. It was just a short little
trip an
hour away but very nice. Our fire kicked ass <tt>:-)</tt>
Unfortunately, there was a Marilyn Manson/Black
Sabbath/some-other-tick-off-the-parents band at the nearby
outdoor
pavillion, and some of the attendees were saving money by
camping. So
we woke up Sunday morning to a distorted voice singing: "My
name is
Lucifer/Please take my hand" or something. Creepy.
