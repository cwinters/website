<h1>SPOPS ideas</h1>

<p>Work work work. Since $COMPANY let some folks go I have
to do icky HTML layout for a redesign. On the upside, new
versions of <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a>
are coming out soon, since the installation I did this
weekend hasn't  blown up yet :-) One of the mailing list
folks has been doing a ton of work to make object linking
and inheritance easier, which is excellent.

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/dmerrill/">dmerrill</a>: Instead of using Pg.pm, try
<a href="http://dbi.symbolstone.org/">DBI</a> and 
<a
href="http://dbi.symbolstone.org/cgi/moduledump?module=DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a>.
 They're quite simple to use and not as tied
to the PostgreSQL API as Pg.pm. There are also wrappers to
make things even simpler and object-oriented (and better
tasting!) such as  &lt;plug&gt; <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a>, which
works just fine with Postgres. <a
