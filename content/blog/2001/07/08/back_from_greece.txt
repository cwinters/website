<h1>Back from Greece</h1>

<p>Vacation was excellent (many rolls of film are being
developed as I
type) and it really made me aware that we need to take time
like this
more often. (Yeah, same story, I know.) A week into our time
away it
dawned on me that I've never taken this much time (two
weeks) away for
a vacation as an adult. That's sad.

<p>Greece is a lovely country, but there are quite a few
cultural
adjustments. For instance, the attitude toward animals. We
knew going
over there would be strays, but nothing like we saw. The
number of
strays (dogs and cats) in Athens was shocking. But IMO even
worse was
the number in smaller towns -- you expect that in big cities
no matter
where you are. Apparently -- we asked a number of people
about it --
it's considered cruel and unnatural to spay or neuter an
animal. And
in fact plans to do so by consciencious vets are met with
outright
hostility.

<p>Another thing I've noticed since I've been back -- I
really didn't
miss hearing about all the latest news, software, etc. I can
be quite
a junkie when it comes to the usual open-source, software,
news, forum
haunts that are out there, but it's such a timesuck. I'm
going to try
to limit my reading in the coming weeks -- we'll see how that
works.

<p>And of course, when I got back there was lots of
disturbing news
about work. Oh well. Lots of fun work awaits -- I should be
able to
get iterators out within the week and one of the list
members has come
up with some great ideas for <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> and object
linking
features. I also hope to have time to look into this
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/Reefknot/">Reefknot</a> stuff a little more...
