<h1>New OI/SPOPS out, GDBM kicked to the curb</h1>

<p>Put out new versions of <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract">OpenInteract</a> and <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS">SPOPS</a> this weekend. GDBM is no longer
required for OpenInteract and as a result of that we moved
to a package repository (contains) packages scheme. Much
friendlier, and all the package stuff isn't in one
module.

<p>Also attended a meeting of the <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/pgh.pm">Pittsburgh Perl
Mongers</a> on Sunday. We hadn't met in a while so many
people were new (including me). It was nice to be able to
talk about a computer language other than Java with people
<tt>:-)</tt>. Some seriously smart people were there, but
everyone was very nice and not the bullying sort of geek you
sometimes run into.

<p>Deadlines at work this week. Fun.
