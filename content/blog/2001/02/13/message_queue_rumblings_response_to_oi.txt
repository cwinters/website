<h1>Message queue rumblings, response to OI</h1>

<p>Response so far is pretty decent to <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> -- we
got a couple of minor patches for SPOPS from one person and
a potential porter for Postgres as well. Not bad for a
little more than a week. (I was also psyched to see a
handful of what I consider to be very smart Perl folks on
the -dev list.)

<p>I have a number of ideas (and a growing itch) for a
generalized message queue system in
Perl -- reading up on this <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">in Java</a> has
given me lots of ideas. Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to
be much out there. Message queues seem to solve a lot of
common problems. But they're probably more complicated than
I can imagine right now.

<p>In work news, they agreed to let me release my minor <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</a> taskdef under
a BSD license. And we're moving from a client-server (VB-MS
SQL Server) system to an application  server (EJB)
environment. And I'm the most experienced Java programmer.
And I just learned Java three months ago. Fun!
