<h1>OpenInteract is in the house!</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> is now out
there! Code is available on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openinteract/">Sourceforge</a>
along with mailing lists, etc. Freshmeat page is coming
soon, as is one for SPOPS. Both are also available via <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> as well as in handy
<tt>Bundle::</tt> form. 

<p>It's at a very usable point now -- yes, there are bugs,
but none of them are showstoppers and I had passed the point
of diminishing returns quite some time ago. Someone else
(preferably many someone elses) looking at the code would be
a good thing. I think the code is quite decent -- I tried to
be readable, although in some areas methods are too long and
need to be refactored. And it really is a pretty cool
product. We'll see.

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/jauderho/">jauderho</a>: I feel your pain regarding
LDAP. The idea that someone's name is essentially acting as
the primary key sends shivers down my spine.
