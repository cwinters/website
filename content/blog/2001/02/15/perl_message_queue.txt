<h1>Perl Message Queue</h1>

<p>I posted a message about message queues in perl to clpm
but no newsgroup response. A couple interesting items via
email, but that's it. So the <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/PerlMQ/">PerlMQ</a> project now exists on
sourceforge.  Of course, there's nothing <b>there</b> yet,
but there's a mailing list and the pressure for me to make
sense of the pages of notes and many ideas I have running
around right now :-)

<p>I'm not sure how long I can continue to do consulting
work in addition to real work and having a life (or trying,
anyway). We're soon going to have to get heavy duty into
design at real work and then a brief (2-3 week) blitzkrieg
of stored procedure -&gt; session bean (likely) translation so
we can let it germinate for a bit and see what we've got. At
least life is interesting...
