<h1>My keyboard kicks ass</h1>

<p>Not to be preachy-pete, but I noticed a few people here
talking about wrist pain. I know it's not universally
applicable to every problem, but I'll put my two cents in
for the <a
href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">Kinesis
Ergo contoured keyboard</a>. (That link goes directly to a
frame -- lop off the page name for more info.)

<p>I got this thing about <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/cwinters/diary.html?start=7">nine
months ago</a> and have had little to no wrist pain since.
It took about a week to get used to it, and I think it would
be much more difficult (maybe impossible) if you're not a
touch-typist. (But then you could argue that a coder not
being a touch typist is like a carpenter not being good with
a hammer.) Typing is one of the few things I learned in high
school that I use every single day.

<p>The keyboard is pricey compared to normal ones (around
$250 for the Classic version), but considering the
alternative it's worth every penny. It's also well-built --
my friend Christian has been using his for 4+ years and it
still works great. He takes advantage of the macro and
keymapping stuff of the keyboard as well.

<p>One of the only difficult things is that once you get
used to it going back to a normal keyboard is a bit of a
chore -- takes about a half-hour for me, although I
try to minimize it as much as possible. After I got a new
job I took my keyboard to work with me every day to work on
Java and brought it home to work on Perl. But I don't have
to do this anymore since work just bought me one.
