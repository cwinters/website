<h1>Hooking up with OpenThought</h1>

<p>I realize I'm probably tempting fate by releasing new
versions of both <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> at 2 in the morning. But so it goes: 1.3
(tons of cool stuff) and 0.50 (mostly bugfixes +
enhancements) are on the street.

<p>Built a relatively small website the other day using
(gasp!) server-side includes. Refreshing to go back to the
extremely short iteration cycles of that type of
development, even though I have no patience for mucking with
HTML anymore.

<p>Also connecting with the developer of <a
href="http://www.openthought.net/">OpenThought</a>, another
Perl webapp server. But it approaches things very
differently from OpenInteract -- lots of Javascript as it
tries to be more of a traditional application. Interesting.

<p>Thing is, he's got many of the same needs as all the
other 11 million webapp servers: authentication, data
abstraction, sessions.... And hey, why not create a layer
that works with everything? So we're hashing that out over
email right now. He came to <a
href="http://www.cwinters.com/yapc-2001/">my talk</a> at <a
href="http://www.yapc.org/NorthAmerica/">YAPC in June</a>
(and even got one of the t-shirts!). And he's not far away
(relatively: probably 3-4 hours driving), so it might be
cool as this thing progresses to get together
.

<p>Still trying to think of a name for the project. I suck
at that.
