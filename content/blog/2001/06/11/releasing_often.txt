<h1>Releasing often</h1>

<p>New versions of <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> (1.07) and
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> (0.40) have been released. I took
<b>way</b> too long to make these releases happen -- getting
away from the 'release early, release often' idea. I think
one of the reasons this idea is important is that people are
more willing to invest their own time in a project that's
active, and a good measure for 'active' is time between
releases.

<p>OTOH, nobody likes releases a few weeks apart that only
fix a handful of minor bugs.

<p>Hardware update #1: new keywell for Kinesis keyboard came
as advertised on friday. It was a little difficult to get
the connector out of the slot -- kind of like getting a
snapped key from a lock -- but I eventually got it out. I
have a normal keyboard again!

<p>Hardware update #2: new motherboard, cpu and memory got
RMA'd back to $VENDOR. They couldn't figure it out either.

<p>I noticed I'm posting more often here in the last couple
of weeks, almost certainly because I'm not working directly
with people anymore. I'm trying to be very conscious of any
unintentional changes in my lifestyle so I don't get out of
control again. Then again, I just worked all weekend...
