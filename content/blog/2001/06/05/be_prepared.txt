<h1>Be prepared!</h1>

<p>Icky hardware stuff: got snazzy new mb and cpu but
problems abound. Methinks it's a problem with the power
supply, new one coming will test that out. Way, way too much
time spent screwing around with it, reading forums,
newsgroups, scouring google, etc. Arg.

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> now supports lazy loading, which means
that listing hundreds of HTML page objects won't eat up all
your memory and demand more.  (Doh!) New release (0.40)
should be out shortly.

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> is going well. I created a
relatively simple
project management app for myself, mostly for the app but
also to get back up to speed on things. Mission accomplished
on both counts.

<p>Did an informal presentation about OI last friday down in
DC. Wouldn't you know it, I'd neglected to install a browser
on my laptop, so it was all talk talk talk. A couple of
people seemed to really get it, which was nice. I think
after <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC</a> I'm
going to make an effort to get around to various perl user
groups to give a talk on OI, as well. By then, I'll have a
browser on my laptop and even prepared slides!
