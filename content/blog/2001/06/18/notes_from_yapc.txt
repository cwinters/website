<h1>Notes from YAPC</h1>

<p>Got back from <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">YAPC NA</a>
yesterday. Tons o fun. Got to talk about
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> in a talk and, despite a few small
technical issues (thanks for crashing Netscape!) things went
well. We gave away a box of t-shirts too, which is always a
nice introduction. (Geeks are such suckers for t-shirts,
myself included of course.)

<p>Montreal seemed like a decent city but it's difficult to
say from my limited exposure. I did a bit of exploring, but
it was pretty aimless and geared to just get me out and
about rather than learning. (Although the Basilica of St.
Patrick's was quite impressive.)

<p>Lots of fun stuff at YAPC: normal Damian Conway
entertainment and mindbending stuff, the 'delta force' of
hackers who can't decide what to do for lunch/dinner, rants
about project management/testing/etc. from Mr. Schwern.
Things were a little different this year for me since I was
visiting the city rather than going home every night. Made
for more immersion :-)

<p> I sat in on a calendaring BOF (hi <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/srl/">srl</a>
and <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Skud/">Skud</a>). It might be interesting to have
some <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> objects you could use to serialize
calendaring
information -- you could in theory plug it into
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/Reefknot/">Reefknot</a> and have it Just Work as part of its
storage layer. (In theory.)

<p>But that (among other things) will have to wait a bit --
we're finally (we got married last April) going on our
honeymoon to Greece starting Thursday. As long as there's
money in the bank account, we should have a wonderful time
despite our disorganized best efforts to try otherwise.

<p>Also, in a rare bit of airplane and conference
productivity, implemented iterators for SPOPS and
SPOPS::DBI, which might make it out the door before we leave
if I have a fit of sleeplessness...
