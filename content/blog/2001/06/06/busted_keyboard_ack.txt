<h1>Busted keyboard -ack!</h1>

<p>Ack -- while cleaning my <a
href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">Kinesis
countoured keyboard</a> I broke one of the connections from
the one set of keys to the controller, so
the entire left-hand side won't work.  (I'm so gd
clumsy sometimes...) I've grown terribly dependent on it and
am afraid the nasty wrist pain will come back since I'm back
on the standard keyboard.

<p>There's been a couple of folks in Cornell doing neat-o
stuff with <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> -- it's very fulfilling when
people take something you've coded, even if it has a fairly
narrow purpose, and do something you never thought of with
it.
