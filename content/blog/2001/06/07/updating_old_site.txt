<h1>Updating old site</h1>

<p>The nice people at kinesis are sending me a new keywell
(that's their term for it) for just $30, plus shipping so,
unless I screw something else up, I'll be back in
typing-happy land again tomorror. Cool.

<p>Slogging through a fairly large <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a>
site done on an old (6 month) version by some junior
programmers. Fun. But at least while I'm doing that I'm
finding featurelets to add (and adding them) and bugs to
fix (and fixing them). On the downside, it's delaying the
1.07 OI release and the 0.40 <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> release and
stealing time away from another Really Important Deadline as
well as preparing a presentation for <a
href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC</a>.

<p>(BTW, just curious: is anyone from Advogato going to
YAPC?)

<p>Also, someone just came out with an alpha for <a
href="http://turnerville.virtualave.net/">DBD::LDAP</a>,
which if it works well would be superfly since we could
plug it into SPOPS and have it Just Work.
