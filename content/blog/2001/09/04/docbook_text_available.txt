<h1>Docbook text available</h1>

<p>Did you know that the O'Reilly book <a
href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/docbook/">DocBook: The
Definitive Guide</a> is <a
href="http://www.docbook.org/">now available</a> under the
GNU Free Documentation License? Maybe this is old news, but
it's still cool!

<p>Starting to organize the <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a>
documentation, including a standalone manual. Trying to
swipe ideas from the Template Toolkit doc process -- might
as well steal from really smart people.

<p>Trying to get motivated, almost working. Undertime still
in effect. Wrote a simple script to grab CVS off sourceforge
every night (just in case...) and FTP the tarballs up to the
<a href="http://www.openinteract.org/snapshots/">main
site</a>. I'm sure there are programs out there to do this,
but I was curious how many lines of perl it would take and
what it would look like (false laziness).
