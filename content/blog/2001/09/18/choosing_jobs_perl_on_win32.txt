<h1>Choosing jobs, Perl on Win32</h1>

<p>Work situation changing rapidly. $COMPANY for which I do
most of my consulting work is teetering. I'm doing a project
for a local company here (last minute rush to try and build
a web app that uses both mysql and DB2 on AS/400 to do
medical claims/referrals processing) that might turn into
something permanent. Positives: use
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a>, work for a single company and see
results of projects, become more integrated with project
development, maybe help define a new team, decent money (I
think). Negatives: in the suburbs, potential dicey office
politics, unsure about company status, working by myself
again (at least for a time).

<p>Being in the suburbs is a major downer for me. Talking
with Barb about it, I realized I've never really had a job
with a traditional 30-60 minute commute in a car. It's
either public transport or the roll-out-of-bed commute.
<p>Forced to play around with Perl on Win32. With
ActiveState and Visual C++ installed, non-PPM'd,
non-pureperl modules can actually compile and get installed
from the CPAN shell. How cool is that! And creating a PPD
file (used in ActiveState's PPM installer/manager) is pretty
simple too -- I found a mailing list posting where Ingy
specified how to do it, built one and emailed it to the
author of Class::Date so maybe he'd post it on his site for
Win32 refugees installing OI.
