<h1>Choosing jobs, again</h1>

<p>Blah blah blah. Uncertain job situation looms -- go to
work for a place that's not as socially fun and out in the
suburbs (driving to work a necessity) but where I can work
on Perl and probably extend <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> on a regular basis. Or work at
$OLDCOMPANY doing J2EE and design work with fun people in a
location (downtown) easily accessible by public
transportation. Stability issues count: $OLDCOMPANY is
pretty stable for 6-9 months, but after that is unknown. The
other place has been around for a while (~20 years) and does
state government work so it won't be going anywhere.

<p>I realize this isn't such a bad situation to be in -- at
least I have a choice -- but I'm getting tired of bouncing
around, and I want to try and keep working on OpenInteract
AMAP but still remain sane. Like I said: blah blah blah.
