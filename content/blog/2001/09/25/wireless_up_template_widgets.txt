<h1>Wireless up, template widgets</h1>

<p>Finally got wireless working. Someone had posted a patch
to get
Ad-Hoc working on Prism2 cards with the Linux-WLAN 0.1.9
release. Compiled it in, worked great. So now the gateway
has two
cabled interfaces (external and internal) and a wireless
internal
interface. A few modifications to the iptables script and
everything
is good to go. I should write up this process so nobody else
has such
pain with these Linksys cards.

<p>Did a ton of work over the last five days to make
building typical
apps in <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> a total piece of cake.
Part of this
was building a common file of 
<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template
Toolkit</a> widgets
and making it available to all templates processed. But this
visibly (!!)
diminished performance, which was puzzling because it should
have only
parsed/compiled the common library once. Looking back into
the custom
TT provider in OI I found that it wasn't doing any caching or
compiling. Doh! A few modifications and it's now happy as a
clam.

<p>Building apps with this new system is excellent -- define the
object, define your templates and some configuration stuff
and you've
basically got a search form, object searching (including on
attributes
in other tables), object display, editing and removal. Just like
that. And I've got an impossible deadline to test it out on.
Always a
good combination....

<p>We also adopted a new cat on Friday from the shelter.
This makes
three cats to two people in the house, so it's officially a
cat house
now. She's lovely, but she seems to drool a lot (!) when she's
happy. Hopefully not a symptom of anything else, because
we've grown
close to her very quickly.
