<h1>IMAP foo, horrible accents</h1>

<p>Whew, that's about done. Cyrus IMAP is now up and
running, a-OK. Just a few more upgrades on that machine
(like moving my website) and I can secure the cover with the
proper screws, stick it in the corner connected to the UPS
and forget about it.

<p>I really, really tried to use <a
href="http://my.gnus.org/">Gnus</a> as a mail client. But
I haven't been using gnus as a newsreader for very long and
haven't quite caught its way of doing things yet. So back to
mutt, which is quite happy with IMAP and which makes me
quite happy. Webmail -- using <a
href="http://www.horde.org/imp/">IMP</a>, which is my first
foray into PHP please forgive me o Perl masters-- is working
too, so the next time we go on a vacation and I connect from
a cafe I won't have to sneakily install PuTTY...

<p>Little hacking done the last few days. I was quite burned
out after heinous amounts of work a couple weeks ago -- <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0932633439">DeMarco</a>'s
notion of undertime seems right on the money to me. Boss
(sorta) called today looking for help on something -- I
tracked down what it should be doing, but turned down a
request to fix it. Dammit, I'm really trying to make
weekends ours, not work's. This crap over the
last couple of weeks reinforced that -- all the work done
for an artificial deadline that wasn't met anyway.
Whoop-dee-doo.

<p>But at least <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> has a shopping
cart and simple catalog system now, probably to be put out
there with the other extra packages. Whatever.

<p>Saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0146309">Thirteen
Days</a> tonight. It wasn't bad, but Kevin Costner's
amazingly bad accent almost ruined it for me.

<p>Went to my first Bat Mitzvah today for one of my wife's
students. Interesting, and one of the passages she was
reading had some interesting commentary about animal
cruelty.

<p>100% human-generated.
