<h1>My keyboard rocks, OI glitch</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/ishmael/">ishmael</a>: My experience with wrist pain
hasn't been too dramatic, I think mainly because I bought <a
href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/classic.htm">a Kinesis
Ergo contoured keyboard</a> before it got too bad. Yeah,
it's around $225 at one of the distributors, but that's
cheap compared to loss
of time and medical bills. It took me about a week to get
used to it, but now I'm extremely fast and only have a
little bit of wrist pain when I work a lot (~70-80 hours a
week). I even convinced my employer to get one for me so I
don't have to carry it to/from work.

<p>Had to release <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> 1.36 since
Randal pointed out a bug in a <tt>mkdir()</tt> call -- Perl
5.005x requires two arguments, 5.6.1 defaults the second one
for you. Doh! (Another, smaller item got fixed as well.)

<p>Upgrade of the major site going well. I'm rewriting all
the custom modules to use the new version -- bonus of this
is that they'll all be open-sourced, so people will be able
to d/l the various packages and have a pretty cool website
(event calendar, link database, contact database, news,
classifieds, shopping cart, simple product database) out of
the box.
