<h1>Using Evolution and moving data</h1>

<p>Scoured through old emails, deleting tons of them along
the way. Everything is available through google now anyway.
Very rewarding experience. Also started using Evolution
(from mutt) at both work and home. Very, very impressed.

<p>Moving the database table creating stuff and the data
import routines from <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> into
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> -- I also added a data exporter to make
for decent portability. Also finally going to rewrite the
object relationship generation code for SPOPS -- the old
stuff will still be supported, but the new methods are much
more flexible.
