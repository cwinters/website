<h1>Looking at Postgres</h1>

<p>Yay, it's allergy season! (blech) Why is it I can
remember a line from a Simpsons episode I last saw three
years ago but I can't remember when my allergies get all
riled up every year. Says something about priorities....

<p>Investigating Postgres more. Got 
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> to pass the limited tests
and 
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract">OpenInteract</a> to 
install on it. Sweet. I think with some more work I'll make
this the database I use on free/fun projects. The only
(small) bone I have to  pick is with the command-line
utilities. Personally, I like the mysql approach for
administration of one binary and many options (e.g.,
<tt>mysqladmin create mydb</tt>) versus the handful of
binaries used by Postgres (initdb, createuser, createdb,
vacuum, ...). But that's quite minor.

<p>Also played some with POE -- neat-o!

<p>I am <b>so</b> looking forward to spring, even with the
sneezing (etc.).

<p>Barb and I are looking to join a gym/club/whatnot. It
will be good for us both, but it's going to take some effort
to stick with it.
