<h1>SPOPS and MS SQL</h1>

<p>Very productive this weekend -- <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> now works with MS SQL Server
and (most likely) with Sybase ASE/ASA. In addition, <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> works with Win32
+ ActivePerl + mod_perl, although Win32/mod_perl isn't as
boss as the Unix mod_perl. Next: testing testing
testing.

<p>Also, very annoying, CPAN + me has been fudging up the
version numbers on things so that people requesting SPOPS
get the (somewhat ancient) version 0.33. (Note to module
authors: if you want a variable to track CVS revisions, be
sure to use something <b>not</b> titled 'VERSION'.) This
will require a quick release, I think, as soon as I test the
new security stuff and the Sybase workings.

<p>It was two years ago yesterday that my mom passed away. I
miss her.
