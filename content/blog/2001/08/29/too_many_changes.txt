<h1>Too many changes</h1>

<p>Oh, how embarrassing. Got  new versions of 
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> out the
door only to find a bug in one of the OI packages
(browser-based object/task security editing won't save the
settings). Ack! Quick release of a new version out as
quickly as possible.

<p>The possibility of this happening probably increases with
the number of changes made between versions. That'll teach
me to change so many things at once.

<p>Now that things aren't so panicked, I'm revisiting the
server issue so I can get IMAP up and running. I'm being
ambitious and trying for <a
href="http://asg2.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus</a> on the first
shot. We'll see...
