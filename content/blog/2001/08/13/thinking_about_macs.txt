<h1>Thinking about macs</h1>

<p>Somehow, the idea of running OS X in one of them new
iBooks has got itself into my brain and refuses to leave.
Part of me recoils in horror at the potential of becoming
part of another <a href="http://slashdot.org/">rabid
community</a>. But it's mostly because it's so damned
<b>cool</b>.

<p>I've never been a Mac person, and it's fascinating to try
and learn something about the technology because you quickly
run into a different language. Task about Pismos this,
Lombardo (?) that, Wallstreet the other thing. It's just
like discussing any number of things in the PC (or
opensource world), but it's still startling to encounter the
first time. It's been a while since I felt like a newbie...
of course, <b>other</b> people probably thought I was, but I
didn't :-) Ignorance is bliss.

<p>The hardware treadmill never ends, does it? I suppose if
I were a handy person I'd be the same way about power tools.
Oh well.

 are mostly patched up now, resulting in lots of cool
features for both <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> and
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a>. I need to release new versions of
both soon, otherwise the <tt>Changes</tt> entries will
become overwhelming.
