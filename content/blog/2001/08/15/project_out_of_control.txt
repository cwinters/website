<h1>Project out of control</h1>

<p>So I'm jamming along, finishing up this LDAP stuff after
having completely rewritten the <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> class
builder system, feeling pretty smug. Going to <a
href="http://www.kennywood.com/">Kennywood</a> tomorrow,
great. Weather has finally cooled down, great. Got some
trance something or other playing that a friend gave me a
while ago.

<p>And then the project from hell comes raining down. You
know, the one where things have been spinning further and
further out of control for months, where the people who were
working on it and had some idea of what it was supposed to
do are gone, where the scope has gone entirely out the
window, where your management is just cutting bait so the
project doesn't continue as a black hole for money and
time.

<p>Yeah, that one. To be finished by Friday (day after
tomorrow). I had forgotten, but <b>that's</b> why I wanted
to become a programmer. Shit.
