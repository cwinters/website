<h1>LDAP serialization, immediate gratification</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/chromatic/">chromatic</a>: You should ping the <a
href="http://dc.pm.org/">DC Perlmongers</a> group (esp the
mailing list) regarding XP in DC. If I still lived down
there I'd be there with bells on :-)

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> 1.2 and <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> 0.50
are pretty much bundled up and ready to go out the door.
Once my guinea pig -- I mean client -- gets everything up
and running, they'll be unleashed. LDAP support for object
serialization and authentication, retrofitting onto existing
directories, is included. Also: better <a
href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">TT</a> integration
with a full provider and plugin; SPOPS code generation has
been totally rewritten to make adding features quite easy
(rules-based setup). The crowd goes wild.

<p>I really need to work on the docs for SPOPS -- it's
getting big enough that I think we need something like what
TT has: each module has its own information and a separate
hierarchy (Template::Manual) has overall information and
binding material. Organization key.

<p>Project from hell pretty much got worked out -- throw
enough time at it for n days straight, hey no problem -- but
of course right on the heels of that the only person who
knows unix went to germany and saddled me with a nasty email
problem. Then someone else had an email problem. (And of
course everyone panics when they have email problems.) I'm
getting the impression our clients are held together with
duct tape.

<p>Also went down to DC for a meeting with a
about-to-sign-the-contract client and closed the deal. Cool.
So OpenInteract will be used on a site that some people
might have actually heard about. (More later, when it's
actually implemented :-)

<p>On my way back from DC stopped by one of the big box
stores and bought five or six CDs. The pleasures of
immediate gratification...
