<h1>Pulling threads</h1>

<p>You know when you've got a thread dangling from a sock
and you start pulling the thread to make it look (and
function) properly? Sometimes the thread breaks after a
short tug and you're all set.

<p>But sometimes you can pull and pull and once you
realize the thread will keep coming and you've pulled out
too much to stop, you see only three options. You can keep
pulling until all there's no more sock and then reweave
everyting. Or you can break it with your fingers but then
you get that bunched up look and that just won't do. Or you
can just get a new sock.

<p>I'm in between the first and the third options... But it
will all be good, once it's done. Really!
