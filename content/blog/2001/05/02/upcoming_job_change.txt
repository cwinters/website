<h1>Upcoming job change</h1>

<p>Another job change is in the future. I'll be working for
myself -- I grabbed the domain name warefor.com just because
it sounded cool in a development sense, marketing sense and
old english sense. Working primarily on
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and implementation projects, which
is excellent. OI development has been stalled for a few
weeks because I'm trying to get a life, so this will
kickstart all that.

<p>More later...
