<h1>Changing jobs</h1>

<p>Well, it's official now: I'm on my own. The previous
place went through some <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/cwinters/diary.html?start=48">recent
turbulence</a> which, combined with the fact that I was
once again the only developer working on a product, got me
looking elsewhere. And where did I wind up? Right back where
I started, basically, except I have much more freedom than
before.

<p>Most of my time is contractually spoken for by one of my
previous employers, which means stability. But the company
I just left is (80% sure) going to hire me for projects and
training as well. Hopefully this will be a good excuse for me
to get out and meet people and see what else is around too
-- something I don't always naturally do.

<p>Before I left, I gave three days of training on the
product I've been working on for the last six months along
with the whole J2EE/EJB/... framework. It seemed to go well,
but I noticed a disturbing tendency in myself to talk in
abstractions rather than use concrete analogies. For one of
them one of our more creative developers rescued me: in
talking about serialization, he made the analogy that you
can talk about food over the phone (a serializable object)
but you can't send a big mac over the phone (a
non-serializable object).

<p>I'm going to miss working in the same office as these
guys -- they could be crude at times, but always clever and
rarely mean-spirited. We'll see what develops.
