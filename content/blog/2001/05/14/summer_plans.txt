<h1>Summer plans</h1>

<p>Plans for the summmer are jelling: 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">yapc</a> in mid-June,
Greece in June/July (finally a honeymoon!) and Monterey,
California for a wedding in early August -- with a few days
for padding. 

<p>I'm getting back into
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a>/<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> development. I
was a little burned out for a bit -- I wonder how often this
happens to other people? I just needed a few weeks away from
thinking about or doing anything with the project (other
than idle wakeup/shower wandering mind thoughts). However, a
developer in Germany has been asking a few questions on the
-dev list and privately about OI and it's been acting as
kindling for more ideas -- surely a good sign. I hope to be
able to drum up interest at yapc, and one of the surest ways
to do that is have excellent docs for people to learn from.
("Gentlemen, you have your assignments.")

<p>I have two more weeks at The Company and then I'm on my
own, although a big chunk of my time is already spoken for,
so it's not as risky as it initially sounds. I still have
some mixed feelings about leaving -- the developers that are
left are generally quite bright and if other folks had
started Java development a couple months ago I might still
be there. But if I'm going to be working by myself, I might
as well be doing someting I really like :-)
