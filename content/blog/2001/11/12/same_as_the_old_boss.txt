<h1>Same as the old boss</h1>

<p>Started the new (old) job today. It looks like I'll
actually be creating non-web graphical interfaces, which is
probably a good thing. The Java part of my brain is slowly
waking up, and it looks like we'll be moving from JBuilder
to Netbeans as a development platform. Netbeans is pretty
massive (tho modular), and it <b>seems</b> that there's a
way to have it use  xemacs as an editor, but I wasn't quite
able to get that to work. (Very beta.) I like the way it
uses virtual filesystems, and the IDE itself is pretty
nifty, altho I definitely need some more memory. (A few mhz
wouldn't hurt, either...)

<p>I was extremely surprised to see that Microsoft released
a JDBC driver for MS SQL Server. I know it's based in large
part on the driver from Merant, but I'd previously filed
this in the 'when pigs fly' category.

<p>It's very strange coming back to this place and going
over my old code to remember what's what. Fortunately I
haven't been cursing myself too much :-) And everyone has
been very warm in welcoming me back.

<p>I wonder: if things go well over the next few months, can
I finagle a cool Mac to work and play with OS X?
