<h1>Slogging through new stuff, jabber</h1>

<p>Slogging along with this new stuff. I both love and hate
this time -- lots of new things to chew on and make more
sense of the world, but I'm not getting anything
<b>done</b>. It'll pass, but it's frustrating.

<p>Setup a jabber server today so I (using gabber) can
reliably  talk to people on msn messenger (work). Very cool
stuff -- relatively easy setup, and it pretty much just
works. Except...the aim gateway works only for about 5
minutes, andthen I get a nice message from the AOL IM server
saying that
I'm using an unsupported client so they're booting me.
Bastards.

<p>Wrestled with reading server config info from a childinit
handler in mod_perl for way too long today, on my own time.
blech.

<p>These <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> folks are
kicking ass and taking names. Sweet.

<p>Figured out that netbeans &lt;-&gt; xemacs thing - tres
cool.
