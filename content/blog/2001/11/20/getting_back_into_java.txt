<h1>Getting back into Java</h1>

<p>(Eeek -- things are getting a little personal around
here. Dumps and hot tubs indeed.)

<p>The Java synapses are firing again, and I'm just about
done reorganizing the code tree and build process so
everything can be run from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</a>. This includes
the database metadata dump (not THAT kind of dump) and the
perl process to build the many (&gt;100) entity and session
beans from the metadata. This actually makes it a process
that someone besides me can execute.

<p>Still haven't gotten out the next
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> yet.
They're ready but I'm a little concerned about the ease with
which people will  be able to upgrade. But things are
settling down a little bit -- one more project for
$OLDCOMPANY #1, then continuing work for $OLDCOMPANY #2 and
things will be ok.

<p>Also: decided that I'll probably switch DSL providers
shortly. To minimize downtime (apparently it's normally  ~3
weeks), I'll get the line put on my home
phone line and then cancel both the DSL service and the
second phone line. Cost savings are good, plus I'll be able
to run a web server at home again since crappy verizon cut
off port 80 a while ago.

<p>I actually went to the online Apple store last night just
to see how much a titanium powerbook would be per month with
financing BS. Very bad.
