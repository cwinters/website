<h1>New car, plus primary key wrangling</h1>

<p>Total non-hacking day yesterday. It was my wife's 30th
birthday (she trails me by almost two years...) and we also
bought a new (used) car. (A 1999 Saturn SC2) We've been
researching and looking around for quite some time, and
because I've been working 1.5 jobs recently we had money for
a good down payment. So that was fun, and surprisingly
painless, too.

<p>I'm going back to <a href="http://www.optiron.com/"
target="_blank">my previous job</a> starting next Monday.
Hopefully I won't be changing jobs again for quite some
time. I'm going over to a past-and-future co-worker's house
later for a fried food fest and the Steelers game. (We'll be
going to the gym beforehand to stave off any artery
hardening...)

<p>Also figured out how to painlessly adapt
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> to use multiple-field primary keys. (They
 should be outlawed in new apps, but it's useful to use
legacy datastores.) This should be in the next release.

<p>I'm really looking forward to a sane work situation
again.
