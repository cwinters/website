<h1>New OI/SPOPS, why no CJAN?</h1>

<p>Finally got latest versions out. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> 0.53
was a week ago, then a helpful developer pointed out a bug
which was promptly fixed by 0.54. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a>
1.35 has a very extensive <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=16810&release_id=63337">Changelog</a>,
particularly when you consider that most of the interesting
stuff happens in the packages, each of which has their own
log.

<p>Now that it's released, I need to upgrade a site running
(IIRC)
1.2 to 1.35. It will be a little difficult but hopefully not
too bad. It will be a chance to create a 'common upgrade
experience' type of log, altho I don't know how many people
actually upgrade.

<p>In general, I don't hear much from people using
OpenInteract. This could be a good thing -- I put a
<b>lot</b> of effort into making installation easy, so maybe
people just understand it and are working merrily away -- or
a bad thing -- they try it for a bit, don't get immediate
gratification and throw it on the scrap heap. General
feedback is nice every once in a while :-)

<p>Java stuff is going ok. I still get frustrated when easy
things aren't easy, but that's just java. I'm trying to keep
the attitude that Java is something I want to get very good
at -- at least somewhere around my current Perl proficiency.

<p>An idle thought -- why hasn't someone taken the <a
href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> tools and just created
a CJAN from them? Clearly some of the items are different --
there's no standard for building/testing as in Perl, but at
least it gives you a powerful
registration/browsing/mirroring/distribution system. There's
always the canard that the tools should be written in the
language they're dealing with. My answer to this is: let's
get it working, then you and the other language purists can
get right on that for version 2 :-)

<p>Java is in a much different area from Perl in this
respect -- Sun acts as a central authority (for APIs, code,
etc.) where Perl has none. Hackers abhor a vacuum, so it got
filled. It's hard to get motivated to fill something that's
already got something (however small) there.
