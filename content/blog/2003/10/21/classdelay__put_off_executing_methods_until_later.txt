<h1>Class::Delay - put off executing methods until later</h1>

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rclamp/Class-Delay-0.01/">Class::Delay</a> - Think of calling 'write' a number of times but not actually performing them until 'flush' is called, or 'insert', 'update' and 'delete' until a 'commit', etc. Very simple usage and implementation, although it looks like you can only delay methods once...
