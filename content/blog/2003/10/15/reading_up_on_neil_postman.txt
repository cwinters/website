<h1>Reading up on Neil Postman</h1>

<a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/archives/000608.html">This note</a> on Neil Postman from hfb led me to <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/10/10/postman/index.html">this Salon eulogy</a>, both of which intrigued me enough to do a brief Amazon information scrape. Definitely someone I need to read up on, not just as a media critic (which seems to be a role others have shoehorned him into) but also as someone who fundamentally questions the explicit and implicit effects of technology.
