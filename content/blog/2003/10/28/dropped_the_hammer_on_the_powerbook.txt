<h1>Dropped the hammer on the Powerbook</h1>

This morning I moseyed on over to the online Apple Store and purchased a stock 15" Aluminum Powerbook with 512MB and a Superdrive. I got stock just in case I need to do a trade-in (all those stories of white spots on the screen make me a little nervous). I'll probably wind up adding some more memory in the near future, depending on the performance. And I used the online Apple Store for the education discount we get since Barb is a full-time teacher, saving ~$450 on the computer and Applecare. (No physical Apple Stores near us, unfortunately.)

<p>I also picked up a D-Link wireless router from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">newegg</a> (nothing but good experiences with them) and a USB Kinesis-Ergo keyboard from <a href="http://www.officeorganix.com/">Office Organix</a> (no dealings but good prices).</p>

<p>The only downer is the estimated shipping time for the laptop: 10-15 business days. Ouch. The countdown begins...</p>
