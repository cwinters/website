<h1>More Matrix  stuff</h1>

I'm about to burst with upcoming expectations. Not only will I be able to order my new powerbook soon, but the final Matrix film is less than two weeks away. Gah!

<p>Came across this "mother of all spoilers" <a href="http://www.netalive.org/stuff/matrix-revolutions_mother-of-all-spoilers.txt">discussion</a> about what the Matrix <b>really</b> is. Good stuff. Diego also had some additional <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002371.html">ideas</a> after watching the Reloaded DVD again...
