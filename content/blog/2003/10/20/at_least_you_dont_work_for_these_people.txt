<h1>At least you don't work for these people</h1>

From <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/17/41OPcringely_1.html">Cringely</a>:

<blockquote>...But the best stupid layoff story concerns the CEO of a small firm who gathered all employees in his office, put everyone's name in a hat, and had his secretary pull two of them. "You've won an all-expenses-paid trip to the local unemployment office!" And people say corporate America has no heart.</blockquote>

<p>...and they wonder why people don't give a shit about work anymore...</p>
