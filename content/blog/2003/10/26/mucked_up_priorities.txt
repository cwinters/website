<h1>Mucked up priorities?</h1>

One of my co-workers called up yesterday asking if I wanted to come with him to the Steelers game today (extra ticket, relatives have season tickets, etc.). I immediately agreed and we made plans, but once I hung up the phone I thought: "I'm can't see all of 'Meet the Press'!" How messed up is that?
