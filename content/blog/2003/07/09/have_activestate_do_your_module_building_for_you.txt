<h1>Have ActiveState do your module building for you</h1>

I just learned that not only does ActiveState try to build a PPM for every module on CPAN, not only does it keep a <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8.html">record</a> of what successfully built, it also keeps test results for some of the ones that fail. In my case I learned that SPOPS fails to build on Win32 for some <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8-windows/windows-5.8/SPOPS-0.76.txt">weird reasons</a>. Gotta get on those.
