<h1>Zoidberg: A modular Perl shell</h1>

<a href="http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net/">Zoidberg</a> - Sounds cool to me (plugins are easy to write), but purists might not like the following from the FAQ:

<blockquote>
What's with the name?
<br><br>
If you don't know where the name comes from, you
should watch more cartoons.
<br><br>
Quoting some futurama episode about a certain doctor Zoidberg :
<br><br>
  "He's a weird monster who smells
      like he eats garbage and does"
<br><br>
This program was from the very beginning intended to become a
huge and bloated monster.
