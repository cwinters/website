<h1>Why people hate politicians</h1>

<a href="http://post-gazette.com/pg/03358/254371.stm">Stealth legislation</a> - So I'm a legislator and I want to ensure the factory farms pumping money (barely trackable thanks to PA's 19th century lobbying laws) into my campaign and party. What to do? I know! I'll disallow local jurisdictions from having a say on environmental quality! And I'll put the measure in a bill nobody could possibly vote against! And I'll do it over the weekend!

<p>No shame these people have, no fucking shame.
