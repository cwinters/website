<h1>It's a rule, except when it's not</h1>

From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27273-2003Apr23.html">Frist and Specter Defend Santorum</a>, more straight talk from the administration:

<blockquote>At the White House, meanwhile, press secretary Ari Fleischer said President Bush would not comment on Santorum's remarks, because "the president typically never does comment on anything involving a Supreme Court case."</blockquote>

<blockquote>When a reporter pointed out that Bush recently weighed in on a Michigan affirmative action case before the court, Fleischer said that was why he had used the word "typically."</blockquote>
