<h1>More narcissistic googling</h1>

Yesterday I got an email from a <a href="http://www.kalitechna.com/">woman</a> I knew twenty years ago who found me through her <a href="/bio/long.html">name on my site</a>. A few years ago in one of those slightly creepy and nostalgic "what are they doing now?" moods I found her through google. We'd chatted for a while then dropped out of touch.

<p>So I used this as a flimsy excuse to google my name again. Still at the top for 'chris winters', and I've moved up to number 3 for just 'winters', although I don't think it's right that I'm ahead of Jonathan Winters of the City of Winters. I also found a link to a <a href="http://www.richardwinters.com/">Richard Winters's blog</a> -- I read so many programming journals that one about medicine is quite refreshing.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone I'm related to has a website or blog except my <a href="http://www.kirkwinters.com/">cousin</a>. But you never know who's blogging...</p>
