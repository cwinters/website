<h1>YAPC talk acceptance rate: 50%</h1>

So my shorter talk on generating Java with Perl (the code generation system <a href="/programming/code_generation_fun.html">discussed briefly elsewhere</a>) was <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/sched/">accepted at YAPC</a> (day 1), but my longer talk on <a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/twiki/view/OI/OpenInteract2">OpenInteract 2</a> wasn't. Kind of disappointing, but also a bit of a relief. I've been working a ton on OI2 in the last few weeks, and I wasn't entirely looking forward to feverishly working on both the app and the presentation. (I admit that a part of me was: it's very rewarding to put in hard work on something you love.) 

<p>I'm still going to shoot for having OI2 out by YAPC time. And I see a possible BOF session at the conference as well...</p>
