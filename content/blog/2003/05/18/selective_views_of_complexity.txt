<h1>Selective views of complexity</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4449-2003May17.html">Bush Shows No Fear in Grizzly Territory</a> - I find the administration's arbitrary dismissal and reliance on complexity very troubling. On the one hand, the administration proposes mining in a wilderness known as a sensitive grizzly area, surely knowing that any ecosystem is as complex as you can imagine and that once a regular influx of people and machinery comes in contact with grizzlies we can't predict what will happen. On the other hand they rely on a system brimming with complexity to describe how their tax cuts will create jobs and help the economy while at the same time dismissing the complexity of the government accruing more and more debt.
