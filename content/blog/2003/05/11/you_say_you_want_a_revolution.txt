<h1>You say you want a revolution</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40258-2003May10.html">GOP Eyes Tax Cuts as Annual Events</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/national/11ASSE.html">Bush's Drive for Tax Cut</a> - Does anyone else feel like the gullible relative of a junkie who keeps asking for money to clean up?

<p>Not that I'm a fan of presidents lying, but at least when Clinton lied he didn't cost me a single penny. (Well, unless you count the $70+ million spent for the ongoing witch hunt during his two terms.) Fifty years from now my grandchildren will ask me how we could let this happen and all I'll be able to say is, "We were busy watching 'American Idol.'"</p>
