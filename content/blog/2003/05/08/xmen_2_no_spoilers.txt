<h1>X-Men 2 (no spoilers)</h1>

Saw X-Men 2 tonight with my sister, a former co-worker and some of his friends. Color me impressed. There were some slight logic twists and what-happened-to thoughts here and there, but it's a comic book movie! It was busy as <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001312.html#001312">Charles suggested</a>, but I don't think it detracted from the movie as he did.  Fun all around, even for my sister who's not a (former) comic geek like me.
