<h1>My module in the Perl phalanx</h1>

<a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">Phalanx</a> is a project initiated by the Perl QA <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a> Team to write more tests for the core Perl distribution along with a number of CPAN modules. Apparently it was inspired by the <a href="http://www.poniecode.org/">Ponie</a> project since it needs lots and lots of core and noncore tests to see if replacing the current Perl5 engine with <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> works properly. They're targeting 100 modules to improve the tests, and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/CWINTERS/SPOPS-0.79/">SPOPS</a> is among them. What's even cooler than this is that they're trying to recruit newer programmers to do this, killing the 'learn to test', 'learn perl modules', and 'become part of this great community' birds with one stone. We'll see how it flies...

<p>Anyway, I think this can be interpreted as a good thing for me as well, the <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/SPOPS">crappy lone rating</a> for SPOPS notwithstanding.
