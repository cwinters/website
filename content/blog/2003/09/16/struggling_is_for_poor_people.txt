<h1>Struggling is for poor people</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15664-2003Sep15.html">Handing Out Hardship</a> - E. J. Dionne with a nice piece about the financial priorities of the administration and other Republicans. It seems that single mothers coming off welfare aren't a priority as the GOP wants to hold down spending for their child care. But don't you think for a second they don't care about the working class:

<blockquote>...Warning against the idea of child care as an entitlement, Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, reassured us: "Making people struggle a little bit is not necessarily the worst thing."</blockquote>

<p>Since we're making people struggling to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads, we'll be rolling back the tax cuts to spread the struggle around, right?</p>

<blockquote>No way, said [Vice President Richard] Cheney. "I think it would be a mistake," he replied, "because you can't look at that without considering what its impact would be on the economy. An awful lot of the returns in that top bracket are small businesses, and they provide an awful lot of job growth in this economy."</blockquote>

<p>I think I need to lookup how they define "awful lot" and "small business" to understand how these creatures communicate.</p>
