<h1>Nice phrase for administration policy</h1>

<p>IMO Josh Marshall hit the nail on the head with <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/sept0301.html#0907031101pm">this post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The president has turned 9/11 into a sort of <em>foreign policy perpetual motion machine</em> in which the problems ginned up by policy failures become the rationale for intensifying those policies. The consequences of screw-ups become examples of the power of 'the terrorists'. <em>(emphasis added)</em></blockquote>
