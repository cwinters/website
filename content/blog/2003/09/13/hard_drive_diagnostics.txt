<h1>Hard drive diagnostics</h1>

Seagate has a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/seatools/B7a.html">diagnostic tool</a> that works with non-Seagate drives as well, although it doesn't have as many checks. One thing I really appreciated since I was testing this on my <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=1005">Gentoo</a> Linux mail/web server: in addition to the typical Windows executable that creates the boot disks you can also grab an ISO for a bootable CD with all the tools on it. Pop it in, run a full surface scan and go read a book since scanning 60GB takes a little while... (Runs DR-DOS for an OS.)
