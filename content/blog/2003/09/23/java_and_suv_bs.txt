<h1>Java and SUV BS</h1>

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/09/20#a1762">Java is the SUV of programming tools</a> - What a bunch of crap. Anyone who overgeneralizes like this:

<blockquote>A project done in Java will cost 5 times as much, take twice as long, and be harder to maintain than a project done in a scripting language such as PHP or Perl.</blockquote>

<p>...deserves all the derision they get. But since we'll never be able to create a comparison that pleases everyone we'll just have to be content with cracking open a few more beers to put out the heat...</p>
