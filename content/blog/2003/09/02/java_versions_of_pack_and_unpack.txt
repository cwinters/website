<h1>Java versions of 'pack' and 'unpack'?</h1>

Is anyone familiar with a Java implementation of the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/func/pack.html">pack</a> and <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/func/unpack.html">unpack</a> Perl functions? IMO they're indispensable for doing any sort of data conversion into or exporting data out of a large system, particularly when you're working with vendors who have width-based records. There seems to be a simplified version at this <a href="http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_java.html">programming language comparison</a> but nothing else.
