<h1>Web XP iteration planning tool</h1>

<a href="http://www.xplanner.org/">XPlanner</a> - Looks nifty, although I bet <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> will eventually have most (if not all) of these features. That's an aspect of buying software for your developers that I never see mentioned: try to buy from a vendor somewhat like your own so the dogfood features the vendor needs will overlap with your own. As a corollary it may be worth a second thought buying software from a company radically different than your own -- companies with a thousand employees generally have different needs than those with twenty.
