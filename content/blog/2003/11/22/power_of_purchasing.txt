<h1>Power of purchasing</h1>

Resolved: If people took responsibility for how they spend their money the world would be a better place. So stop shopping at <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html">fucking Wal-Mart</a>! Also useful is <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2003/11/18.html#a520">Dave Pollard's discussion</a> of this article and some of the implications. (This is in place of a potentially more meaningful but practically incoherent rant about money seeming absolve people of responsibility for their actions but actually doing quite the opposite. I was also going to include a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/22/business/22conserve.html">this SUV article</a> that would tie in with a "stop buying fucking SUVs!" grunt.)
