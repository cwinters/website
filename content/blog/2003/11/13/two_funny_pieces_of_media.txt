<h1>Two funny pieces of media</h1>

First we have an alleged <a href="http://www.madsb.com/enrique/indexeng.htm">recording</a> of what Enrique Iglesias <b>really</b> sounds like in concert -- that is, what's he's singing into the microphone while the audience hears a recorded version. (It's worth listening to the whole thing, he really gets into shower territory about 2/3 the way through.) Thanks to <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/">Charles</a> for the link.

<p>Next from <a href="http://www.estey.com/">Gav</a> we have a tricky ladder. Ouch!</p>
