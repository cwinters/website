<h1>Pointing out PHP problems</h1>

<a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2002/papers/html/php/index.html">Experiences of Using PHP in Large Websites</a> - It's old (a year or more, it appears) but seems pretty reasonable. The stuff about the single INI file and the global namespace boggle my mind, I couldn't believe it when I had to screw around with PHP for our (now historic) internal Sourceforge installation. This echoes <a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.advocacy/1458">Gnat's list</a> of PHP shortcomings as well.
