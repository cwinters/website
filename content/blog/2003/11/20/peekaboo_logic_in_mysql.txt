<h1>Peek-a-boo logic in MySQL</h1>

<a href="http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html">MySQL Gotchas</a> - I don't use MySQL anymore mostly because PostgreSQL (installing it, admin tasks, etc.) does everything I need at the speed I need. I'm very surprised by all the cases in MySQL where, if you're going against some specification (like trying to insert an overflowing 99999999999999 into a INT column) it silently tries to massage what you're doing into something that works. The <b>silently</b> part is what kills me -- not something you'd expect from your database.
