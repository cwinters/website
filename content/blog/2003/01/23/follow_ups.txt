<h1>Follow ups</h1>

No matter how many times I read it, I'm never prepared for the volatility of the reactions people have to pair programming. The ones born of experience (like <a href="http://freeroller.net/page/chiara/20030122">Chiara's</a>) seem akin to the aftermath of a bad relationship: you can't imagine how anyone else could be in a successful relationship with that jerk. And then you find out that jerk is seeing someone else and they're perfectly happy and you find yourself humming Ani's <a href="http://www.lyricsspot.com/song.php?s=1690">Untouchable Face</a> morning, noon and night through gritted teeth. The thing is: the match just didn't work between you two. Maybe you got into it for bad reasons -- implementing XP and pair programming to exert more control over programmers is like getting married to keep a relationship together. But that doesn't mean it can't work for someone else. So let it go and have fun doing what you're doing. (You also wonder: if that relationship was so bad, why did I stay? But that gets into a big ugly mess, best not to go there.)

<p>Two: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/business/23WEAL.html">Economic Inequality Grew in 90's Boom, Fed Reports</a> - Oh, yeah, you know all that wealth created in the 1990s. That went to rich people too. Hey, I've got an idea! Let's give them another tax break! (Yes, I'm being unfair.)</p>
