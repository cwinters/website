<h1>Overloaded playing catch up</h1>

I leave for two days to go to a funeral, no TV or web access, and I feel like I've been away for a week or two with all the blogs, news articles, etc. Obviously I didn't really miss anything, but the feeling is a big red warning sign that I'm overextending my information reach, spending more time reading and digesting than doing. Time to cut back....
