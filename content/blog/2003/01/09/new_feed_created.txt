<h1>New feed created</h1>

Thanks to some <a href="http://www.eyde.net/index.do?date=20030109#123448">prodding from Niel</a> I've created a separate Java-only feed and deleted/re-added my entry in the javablogs site. It was actually a useful exercise to modify the script that generates the feed because I encountered the <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html">Zero-One-Infinity</a> rule. So I can now generate feeds for any of the different news section labels.
