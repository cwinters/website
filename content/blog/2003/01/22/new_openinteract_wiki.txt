<h1>New OpenInteract Wiki</h1>

<a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/twiki/view/OI/">OI Wiki</a> - I've been fooling around with this for a few days and figure even with the rough edges it should be public. I moved to <a href="http://www.twiki.org/">TWiki</a> for the implementation because it's what we use at work and I'm very familiar with it. Previously OI had been using <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">UseMod</a>, but I didn't like how the authentication worked and the TWiki markup seems clearer. Installation on the Sourceforge webhost was slightly nonstandard, but some folks <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge">wrote a script</a> for install and with a sane backup strategy we should be cool.

<p>Even though TWiki is a huge beast (for a wiki) with nonstandard coding conventions for Perl (fingernails on chalkboard, ack!), it's fairly easy to create plugins for extending the syntax and functionality, and a <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/WebHome">whole bunch</a> of them already exist. I moved all the pages over from the old Wiki and am planning to use it much more with the version 2 development effort.</p>
