<h1>Weird emails recently</h1>

I've received a couple of odd emails recently. The first had a subject
of "ERROR IN TEMPLATE", which led me to think that a newbie had
installed <a href="http://www.openinteract.org/">OpenInteract</a>;
since it wasn't sent to the mailing list I figured this would be a
fifteen-second read. How mistaken:

<p><pre class="emailcontent">
I PLAY SCRABLE GAME ON-LINE. THE OTHER NIGHT, THE GAME COMES UP, 
BUT NO BOARD OR LETTERS TO PLAY FROM. I HAVE TO QUIT BECAUSE I CANNOT 
PLAY.
SOMETIMES ALL I GET IS A MESSAGE"aN ERROR OCCURED DURING EXECUTION OF 
TEMPLATE".
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO, TO FIX THIS PROBLEM?
</pre>

<p>I'm racking my brain: I'm 99% certain I've never worked on an
online Scrabble game. And if this is spam its purposes are quite
fiendishly obscured, but since spammers have no subtlety it can't be
spam. So, a friendly reply:</p>

<p><pre class="emailcontent">
I'm not sure why you wrote this to me or what your problem is, but I 
wish you the best of luck in taking care of your problem.

<p>The second was actually the third or fourth I've received from this
particular person, whom I actually think is real. (The attempted
Scrabble player is probably real too, come to think of it.) Anyway,
until now they've all been jokes or those Readers Digest-worthy
stories. It's getting delivered to me because someone must have typed
in an address wrong: it's addressed to <tt>buddog@cwinters.com</tt>
and of course all email (except for an address or two) sent to
<tt>cwinters.com</tt> goes to me.</p>

<p>But the latest message is the one that broke the camel's back. It
has a subject: "Fw: Important PETITION". The subdued freneticism
implied by the odd capitalization should have been a clue, but I kept
reading. Here's the heart of the PETITION <tt class="snide">[with
snide comments from me]</tt>, addressed to President Bush:</p>

<blockquote>We, the people of America <tt class="snide">[and
recipients of the email]</tt>, are requesting that you lift the
prohibition of prayer in schools. <tt class="snide">[Of course, any
student, teacher or administrator can pray in school anytime she
wants. To herself.]</tt> As the pledge of our great country states, we
are to be "One nation, under God."  <tt class="snide">[You know the
pledge was written by a <a
href="http://www.geobop.com/Symbols/world/na/us/pledge/">socialist</a>,
right? A socialist, a minority, who enjoyed the same freedom of
expression that you in the majority take for granted.]</tt> Please
allow the prayers and petitions of our children in schools without the
threat of punishment. <tt class="snide">[Good thing everyone's
children can already pray in school Oh, you mean you want everyone to
say the <b>same</b> prayer? That's a little different, isn't it?]</tt>
Currently adults and children in the schools are prohibited from
mentioning God unless, of course, His name is uttered as part of a
curse or profanity. <tt class="snide">[No kidding! So nobody's allowed
to say "God bless you" after a sneeze? Or discuss their beliefs with
other students or teachers? Or talk about the Bible, Koran, Talmud as
historical documents?]</tt> Madeline Murray O'Hare is dead. Let her
legacy of atheism in our schools die with her! <tt
class="snide">[Sounds like the love for our fellow men and women goes
so far.]</tt></blockquote>

<p>This one got an atypical smartass reply:</p>

<p><pre class="emailcontent">
This message was addressed to:
 
  Pat &lt;buddog@cwinters.com&gt;
 
I'm not sure who you're trying to reach, but he/she isn't here.
 
Best wishes for your future reign of cultural imperialism,
 
Chris
