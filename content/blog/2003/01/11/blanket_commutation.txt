<h1>Blanket commutation</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42290-2003Jan11.html">Illinois Gov. Ryan to Empty Death Row</a> - This takes a lot of courage, almost unheard of in today's batch of poll-driven now-centered politicians. Coincidentally I just read an article by Scott Turow (<a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/star/mon/30106editdeathpenalty.html">summarized here</a>) about his involvement in the Illinois commision on the death penalty. It makes you think, even if you're as against the death penalty as I am. (The link goes to a brief AP release; I'll post additional links as they inevitably come.)
