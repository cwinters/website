<h1>Sign that I'm getting used to IDEA...</h1>

...when I'm hacking perl in XEmacs and I start to:

<p><ul>
 <li>...hit Shift-F6 while on a subroutine to rename it everywhere it's used</li>
 <li>...hit Alt-F7 to find all usages of a particular method</li>
 <li>...start highlighting a section of code to automatically extract into a method</li>
</ul>

<p>...only to remember that I can't do that here.</p>
