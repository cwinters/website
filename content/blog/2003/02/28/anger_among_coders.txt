<h1>Anger among coders</h1>

This <a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20030225#arguing_with_scott_meyers">memory</a> from Dave is fantastic:

<blockquote>The student explained that there were some situations in telecommunications systems where A was equal to B, but B was not equal to A. Scott immediately objected, of course, but the student went off into some jargon-filled explanation of his particular problem domain. Scott let the student finish and then said, "if you were to overload the equals operator so that A was equal to B, but B was not equal to A, then I would want to kill you." That was the end of the argument.</blockquote>
