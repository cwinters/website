<h1>Give scripting languages their due</h1>

<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/02/06/06stratdev_1.html?s=tc">Shipping the Prototype</a> - Udell with another great column on why glue -- and more importantly, agile glue -- is so important when everything is moving lickety-split:

<blockquote>In a world of distributed services in constant
flux, when does exploration stop? Why would you ever want to
switch from a codebase that is concise, malleable, and easily
maintainable to one that isn't?</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>My point is that languages like Python, but also Perl, Ruby, and
JavaScript/JScript/ActionScript/EcmaScript, are strategic in
ways that we don't yet fully acknowledge. As I mentioned last
time, the classic phased life cycle of software
development -- design/develop/test/deploy -- is dissolving
into a continuous process. Change is the only constant; the
services we create and use are always exploratory. Languages
that express programmers' intentions in fewer lines of code
are a huge productivity win. The deliverable code is easier
to understand and maintain -- and so, crucially, is the test
infrastructure that supports it.</blockquote>

<p>Maintainability - malleability - testability. Not quite " Libert&#233; - &#233;galit&#233; - fraternit&#233;," but it'll do.</p>
