<h1>AllConsuming OI package, plus delayed gratification</h1>

While surfing around this afternoon I stumbled onto <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/">DJ's blog entry</a> on moving entries from an amazon wishlist to <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">AllConsuming</a>, by way of <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/01/24#23">Ted Leung's post</a> on how CPAN kicks ass. I'd heard about AllConsuming somewhere before (probably from Udell) but I'd just breezed over it.

<p>After a little investigation I found that I could sign up and it would not only keep track of what I was currently reading but also make  it available in an easily consumed format. "A-ha!" I thought. "Sounds like a perfect OpenInteract package." And sure enough it took about 10 minutes to create a new package. (It's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16810">on SourceForge now</a> if you're curious.)</p>

<p>Flush with an easy coding victory, I created a tarball for the package, scp'd it to my web server, installed it and restarted mod_perl. I went to my home page, edited it via the browser to add the box to the right-hand side and... and... and... Doh! AllConsuming.net was down for a few minutes. Everything eventually worked (as you can see), but the delayed gratification was somewhat irritating. I don't have many things I work on right now that are simple to understand and so easy to install and get working. (Maybe I should change that...)</p>
