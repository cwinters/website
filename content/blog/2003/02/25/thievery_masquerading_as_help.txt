<h1>Thievery masquerading as help</h1>

I get an email from ebay with the subject "Please Update Your Ebay.com Account" and right away I'm suspicious. I haven't bought anything off ebay or half.com in a couple months, and this email is telling me that 'Recently we attempted to authorize payment from your credit card....'

<p>While little details look legitimate (copyright notice at the bottom), there are telltale signs that it's a fake. Superficially, the 'Subject:' line is misspelled as 'Eaby Updates &lt;webmaster@ebay.com&gt;' Digging a little deeper, while the link as displayed in the browser <b>looks</b> legit (with the familiar 'eBayISAPI.dll' path), a quick hover and/or message source view shows that it's using the sneaky 'http://fooblah@an.ip.addr.ess/...' syntax. Bastards.</p>

<p>I'm a little surprised this isn't given more (any?) play on the ebay site. Even more surprising: I forwarded the email along with a message to 'webmaster@ebay.com' and got a 'recipient not recognized' bounce. Ouch.</p>
