<h1>CVS to RSS</h1>

This is mostly a bookmark/thought for later: see the current <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/cvs2rss/">cvs2rss</a> package and create something similar that works in a push fashion  placing the data in a data structure with each commit rather than scanning the entire tree. (See examine_cvs OI package for an example of doing this...)
