<h1>More veggie stuff missing the point</h1>

Just when you thought us vegetarians couldn't get any weirder: <a href="http://alcor.concordia.ca/~frigo/haggis.html">Veggie Haggis</a>. I don't generally have a problem with pseudo meat stuff, but <a href="/News/show/?news_id=699">as I mentioned previously</a> some of it is just silly.
