<h1>A social side effect of spam</h1>

In the last couple months lots of spammers have started using real domains as return addresses. Incredibly annoying. And since I've been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=chris%40cwinters.com&btnG=Google+Search">promiscuous</a> in my various net postings I'm a big fat target. By the looks of the bouncebacks, they're taking full advantage.

<p>The problem: if I write to someone and they don't email me back I don't know if it's due to the normal reasons (they're busy, I'm an asshole, etc) or if my message has been filtered by some intervening server because of the spam being sent from my domain. And "did you get my message?" messages can't work either, for the same reason. What a world.</p>

<p>(Yes, this is in reference to a specific incident...)</p>
