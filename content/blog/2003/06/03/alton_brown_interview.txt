<h1>Alton Brown interview</h1>

<a href="http://www.channelguidemag.com/brown/index.html">Some Like it Hot</a> - Pretty good interview with <a href="http://altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>, the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ea">"Good Eats"</a> guy:

<blockquote>I can't talk about anything or write about anything if I don't understand it. So a lot of the stuff that I go through and a lot of the time that I spend is understanding.
