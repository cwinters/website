<h1>First beta of OpenInteract 2.0 out!</h1>

This is a fairly thorough rewrite of the 1.x codebase, but it's not a true rewrite because its core ideas are still pretty much the same. It's been in the works for longer than I care to remember. Can't bear to write anymore summaries about this release so you can <a href="http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/fehzehtweld">read the email</a> I sent out to relevant parties. (BTW, that first line of the mail should read "I am totally fucking ecstatic" instead of "I am happy", but these are family lists...)

<p>And yahoo, I made it before YAPC! And I left three whole days to get my presentation done before the <a href="http://pgh.pm.org/m/200306.html">PA burg bash</a> on Saturday and then YAPC on Monday. Way too much time, maybe I'll try to learn a new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/XML-Handler-AxPoint-1.30/">presentation technology</a> in the meantime...</p>
