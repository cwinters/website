<h1>Preview of tax back-and-forth</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21415-2003Jun22.html?nav=hptoc_p">Bush Cites the Cost Of Tax-Cut Repeal</a> - An easy counter to "a repeal will raise your taxes" is to point out that state and local governments across the country either raised their taxes (sales, property, income) and/or cut services.
