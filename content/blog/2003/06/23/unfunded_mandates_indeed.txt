<h1>Unfunded mandates indeed</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/23/education/23RURA.html">New Federal Law May Leave Many Rural Teachers Behind</a> - This is the 
sort of thing Republicans always refer to when they dismiss "big government" and embrace "states rights." But they're going to have a hard time 
distancing themselves from their wonderfully mushy "No Child Left Behind" act, so maybe instead they'll put up the many billions of dollars necessary to 
raise teachers' salaries to compete. Doubtful...

<blockquote>"To tell teachers who barely make $20,000 a year that they have to go back to college -- frankly it would be easier for them to 
retire or move to a state where they could just teach one subject," said Linda McCulloch, Montana's superintendent of public 
instruction. "This could just throw our educational system into a mess."</blockquote>
