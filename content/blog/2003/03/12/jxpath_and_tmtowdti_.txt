<h1>JXPath and TMTOWDTI </h1>

<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jxpath/index.html">Commons JXPath</a> - The <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/home/thread.jsp?thread_id=18303&article_count=1">announcement</a> on TSS is the first I've heard of this. It's kind of like the JSTL EL but in code. From one of their examples, this JXPath expression:
<pre class="sourceCode">
Address address = (Address)JXPathContext.newContext(vendor).
         getValue("locations[address/zipCode='90210']/address");
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to this Java code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode">
Address address = null;
Collection locations = vendor.getLocations();
Iterator it = locations.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()){
    Location location = (Location)it.next();
    String zipCode = location.getAddress().getZipCode();
    if (zipCode.equals("90210")){
      address = location.getAddress();
      break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Very perlish, don't you think?</p>

<p>It's interesting how a number of the Jakarta Commons projects are implementing these sorts of shortcuts to make verbose Java more succinct -- some of the classes in the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">Commons Collections</a> package library are trying to fold functional idioms (like <tt>map</tt>) into Java, which is most welcome.</p>
