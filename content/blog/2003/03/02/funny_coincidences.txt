<h1>Funny coincidences</h1>

A guy I used to work with wrote a collaborative media platform called <a href="http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/">Scoop</a>; a guy I knew in college runs <a href="http://thescoop.org/">thescoop.org</a> and is a professional journalist who is also <a href="http://www.thescoop.org/car/">a geek</a>. (The fact that you have a blog doesn't automatically make you a geek anymore, although it's a strong indicator.) Further: they are both smart cookies, although I don't know if Rusty can sing or if Derek likes making furniture...

<p>It's not Nostradamus or anything, just funny.</p>
