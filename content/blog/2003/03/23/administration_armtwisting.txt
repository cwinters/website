<h1>Administration arm-twisting</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2713-2003Mar21.html">Bush's Strong Arm Can Club Allies Too</a> - Good article about the hardball tactics taken by the administration to squash and punish dissent, even within the party. Doesn't this sort of strategy always backfire? Everyone plays along because the president is popular right now, but if/when he isn't and Mr. Rove doesn't have a stick to beat people with, all the grudges inflamed by this shoddy treatment are going to boil to the surface. It won't be pretty.
