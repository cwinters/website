<h1>Created news object</h1>

Website news: Created the News object today and tested out briefly. It's fairly complete, but I need to test out the searching capability. Also created templates for editing a news item and displaying any number of them. I'll also need to figure out what I'm going to do with categories. Should they be system-wide, so I can use them for things like links, news and whatever else comes along? Or should we have categories for links, categories for news, etc.?
