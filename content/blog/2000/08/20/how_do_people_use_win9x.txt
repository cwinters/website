<h1>How do people use Win9x?</h1>

<p>How the heck do people use windows 95/98 all the time?
For the few things I use it -- translating Word documents
properly, operating the scanner -- it seems that if I leave
a program open for any length of time without activity (&gt;20
minutes) and then move the mouse to disengage the screen
saver, there's a nice ugly GPF box there. It crashes even
when it's doing <b>nothing</b>?

<p>In the process of writing a document justifying making
OpenInteract (and SPOPS) opensource. It's very fair,
touching on some of the negative aspects as well. But I
think all the work I put into developing a packaging system
will definitely pay off here.

<p>The recent hubbub about PostreSQL benchmarking made me
take another look at it, and I'll probably see how well
OpenInteract works on it in the very near future. It would
be nice to use a database with transactions for <b>all</b>
of our applications, not just for the customers who cough up
the dough for Sybase.

<p>Thinking about ditching cable to help get life back in
balance. The only problem with that is no 'Law and Order'
all the time. But who has time for TV anyway, right?
