<h1>All over the map</h1>

<p>I am beat.

<p>New job is working out pretty well. Java is frustrating
sometimes because in some ways it doesn't have the
flexibility of Perl, and because easy things aren't as easy,
but overall it's pretty nifty. (I'm glad I don't do GUI
development tho -- ick.) Need to get a Linux workstation in
there somehow -- I think I've proved that I'm not a ding
dong, so hopefully I can use the sane argument of
productivity.

<p>My sister is visiting for an undetermined amount of time
-- she needs to get her life straightened out, and I'm
trying to convince her to move up here to Pittsburgh. Not as
many jobs as in DC, but it would (in many ways) be a clean
break for her. Clean breaks are important sometimes.

<p>Trying to do <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/OpenInteract/">OpenInteract</a> and 
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/SPOPS/">SPOPS</a> development after hours but
I think I need to get in better physical shape first, or
something. (See previous statement about being beat.) The
folks at <a href="http://www.intes.net/">intes.net</a> are
planning to do a release, community building and all,
sometime in January, which is cool. I went down there a week
and a half ago for some training which seemed to go very
well. They were stuck on something and blaming the software,
when in fact they "discovered" that you can't use
<tt>HUP</tt> to restart a mod_perl-enabled Apache process
when you want it to re-read libraries. You need to blast
those buggers away and start clean. (Very frustrating lesson
for them, but that's how these lessons stick...)

<p>The steering wheel in the car is shaking in a disturbing
way. This equates to money. We've decided that we won't be
getting a new car -- either an old one or fix the existing
one. This makes practical sense but I must admit that I was
looking forward to a new car. I've never owned a car before.
But I suppose the rush wears off after a bit. (Unless you've
got a cool convertible like Mr. Fancy Pants
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/kuro5hin/">kuro5hin</a>.)

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/ErikLevy/">ErikLevy</a>: You should only need to logout
and log back in to get changes made to /etc/profile. Try
opening a new XTerm after you make the changes to see...
