<h1>Post wedding, plus banner ad management</h1>

Been a while. We had a fantastic time at the wedding a couple weeks ago, and were so happy so many people could come. The only thing I regret is that the time could have been stretched out for just me and Barb, because we didn't get to talk to everyone we wanted to.

<p>I'll get some photos up soon. We've only got the ones from the disposable cameras so far, but there were definitely some good ones there.</p>

<p>Been working on a banner ad management system for the last week. I think it's going to be really cool. It uses the new Collection classes so some things are a little easier. They may also allow us to not use the Template Toolkit and use a faster (or homegrown) module for processing templates. We'll see. </p>
