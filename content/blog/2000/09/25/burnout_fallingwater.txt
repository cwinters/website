<h1>Burnout, Fallingwater</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/jfs/">jfs</a>:
Check out <a
href="http://www.openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</a> for a
open-source LDAP
server. They recently put out v. 2.0 which (I believe)
implements
version 3 of the LDAP protocol. (Haven't had time to play
with it
recently -- previous versions worked great.)

<p>The book <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0932633439">Peopleware</a>
discusses the idea that there is no such thing as overtime.
However
many hours you work over some figure (around 40 hours,
varying some
per person) for a week you will eventually have a roughly
equivalent amount of
<em>undertime</em>. Undertime is not just sitting around
doing nothing
(although that counts too), but doing things like reading
advogato and
for every person who has posted a diary entry checking out
their
description, homepage, branching off into links from there,
talking to
people around the "watercooler", taking long lunches, coming
to work
later and leaving earlier, etc.

<p>Some people have a hard time separating this from
laziness, but too
little undertime leads to burn-out time. Of course, those
same people
probably thing burn-out time is laziness too...

<p>I staved off burn-out time (a little) by going camping
with B and some of her family this weekend around Ohiopyle. Also saw
Fallingwater, which was pretty amazing. The attention to
detail was admirable, as were some of the solutions they devised to get
around some of the difficulties resulting from integrating the
building so closely with its surroundings.

<p>For instance, in one area water leaked through a rock
formation that was also inside the house. The first time it happened
after a big rainstorm, the water ran down a hall and through the first
floor before making its way down to the stream. Instead of trying
to prevent the water from running at all (which would have been
futile), they simply put a hole in the floor next to the rock inside the
house so the water could drain -- they worked <b>with</b> the water
rather than trying to force it into a desired behavior. Nice lesson.
