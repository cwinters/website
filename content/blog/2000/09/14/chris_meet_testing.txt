<h1>Chris, meet testing</h1>

<p>I need to start writing software as if it will be
released to lots of people tomorrow :) Interestingly, the
potential (up to 90% I'd say) release of OpenInteract has
coincided with my first reading of Kent Beck's book <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0201616416">Extreme
Programming Explained</a>. I know, I'm probably a whole 18
months (meaning: eternity) behind the rest of the software
development community, but it's new to me.

<p>Anyway, XP places a lot of emphasis on testing, an area
where my discipline is sorely lacking. The happy coincidence
is that releasing for other people also forces me to write
tests, just so they'll know everything at least nominally
works. This way, I have an excuse to get in the habit of
doing something I should be doing anyway. Happy day!

<p>A nice side benefit of the SPOPS DBI tests is that it
should be easy to find out whether particular DBD drivers
support the necessary <tt>{NAME}</tt> and <tt>{TYPE}</tt> attributes or not.
(I think drivers for most 'modern' databases do.)

<p>Cleaning up the code (which isn't much of the work) and
making it presentable (read: installable by someone other
than me) also means that I get to hack around a bit in the
<tt>Makefile.PL</tt> and <tt>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</tt> land. Eeek! But it's
coming along -- it's done for SPOPS, I just need to figure
out how to get a normal script (to install the packages,
etc.) to run after 'make install'. This is a very powerful
software package, and the perl way is to make easy things
easy, so... where's the easy part? (Personally, I don't
qualify editing a Makefile as easy, but I can be a little
dense sometimes.)

<p>The nutty thing is that you can (apparently) use
E::MM to create PPM files (for ActivePerl users) and for
this you can use the 'PPM_INSTALL_SCRIPT' key to specify a
program to run after the package/module is installed. So
someone recognized this as a good idea to do. Double
eeek!
