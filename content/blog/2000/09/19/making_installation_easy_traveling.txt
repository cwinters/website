<h1>Making installation easy, traveling</h1>

<p>OpenInteract is coming along very well. Last few
bleary-eyed days have been spent hip deep in making
installation procedures EZ for everyone and getting the
packaging scheme stable. A product like ours aimed at
developers really has to lower as many barriers to entry as
possibly, lower the cost of trying it out and getting
interested and exploring. Making it easy to install, easy to
extend and easy to share code is one of those ways (a BIG
one, IMO).

<p>Also good news on the open source front: recent stridency
on my part has is helping to convince management that, yes,
open source will be a Good Thing for the company. I think
we're moving to the 'which license do we choose?' part of
the argument and saying goodbye to the 'why the heck would
we choose one of these open source licenses?' part.

<p>The fact that everyone is sick, that we're going
camping in OhioPyle this weekend (and seeing Fallingwater!)
and that it's supposed to be rainy and cold
makes me nervous that I'll catch something....

<p>Also found out that I'll probably be going to Germany for
a week next Wed/Thu/Fri. For some reason, every time I go
over there I can't sleep on the plane and get there at 8 am.
Everyone else is ready for a full day of work and I slog 
through so by the end of the day I'm <b>beyond</b> tired and
when I fall into a fitful rest, I have
bizarre-yet-almost-real dreams where I'm hovering on the
edge of consciousness yet can't break out of sleep.
Hopefully that won't happen :)

<p>Uh oh, run-on sentences... time for sleep.
