<h1>Drive-thru strippers</h1>

Haven't written in a while, but I had to get this down. When you hear the words "drive-thru" you think: burgers, tacos, chicken, donuts, coffee. In suburban Pittsburgh, you can now add to that list: strippers. It's true! You can drive up to the club and see women take off their clothes without ever leaving your car. Just when I thought American ingenuity had exhausted all uses of the drive-thru window, here comes this. I am impressed. Read the <a href="http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/pit/news/stories/news-20000602-003244.html">Pittsburgh Channel news story</a> on it and see the <a href="http://www.climaxredtop.com">club's website</a> complete with grammar errors -- but be warned, there are probably naked women there :)
