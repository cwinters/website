<h1>Building manifests, approaching deities</h1>

<p>Making a trip down to DC tomorrow to visit the 
home office. Should be... interesting. Enough for now, more
later.

<p>Added some cool functionality to the package management
program. Christian thought it was lame (not his words)
that whenever you exported a package (to a .tar.gz dist
file) it took <b>all</b> the files in the package 
directory. He said, why don't you use a MANIFEST file 
(just like perl modules) and the ExtUtils stuff for it?

<p>Sure enough, <tt>ExtUtils::Manifest</tt> does exactly
that -- creates MANIFEST files, reads them in and does
checks (files in MANIFEST not in the fs, files in the fs
not in MANIFEST) for you to ensure everything matches up. It
even copies all the files into a separate directory of your
choosing, making it easy to use something like
<tt>Archive::Tar</tt> to create a distribution file (even on
Win32 machines).
How cool is that? 

<p>I did find a little annoyance about the module but was
hesitant to send it to Perl demigod Andreas Koenig just
because I figured he had already thought of it (being a
demigod and all). I turned this over for a bit, not wanting
to look foolish, and sent it anyway. One of the cool things
about this community is that most people won't bite your ass
off if you're trying to be helpful and do sufficient
research and testing before bothering them. Even the
demigods.

<p>For today's excitement: the hard drive in the machine
storing our CVS repository crashed. At first I didn't know
what was wrong, the machine wasn't responding to cvs or ssh
but it was sending back pings. I called up the office and
asked someone to take a look at it. He called me back two
minutes later and said, "Well, I have some bad news...",
instantly giving me that bad feeling in the pit of your
stomach that you have when you do a 'rm -rf' on something
and realize that the prompt is taking <b>way</b> too long to
return. 

<p>Fortunately, the partition with CVS was recoverable and
we promptly put it on a machine with access to the backup
system. That could have been a really painful lesson --
really dodged a bullet.
