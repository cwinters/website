<h1>Fatality, Tipping Point, plumbing</h1>

<p>Funny node on perlmonks, a site that's rapidly addicting
itself to me:
<a
href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=33824">Mortal
Kombat</a>

<p>When people say they are (or provide) 'the plumbing of
the internet', I'd like to be there when they have to take a
plunger to the thing because someone's been putting their
food down the drain and it's been backing up in the
stationary tub in the basement. 

<p>Even thought it has a lot of generalizations, <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0316316962"><i>The
Tipping Point</i></a> is one of the best books I read in a
while. I love cross-disciplinary stuff like this that's
still accessible to us non-geniuses who don't read <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0465026567"><i>Goedel,
Escher, Bach</i></a> while they're on the can with just a
few minutes to kill...
