<h1>TV Week: Absurdity for a buck fifty</h1>

<p>Couple of funny things:

<p>First, from a recent <i>TV Week</i> distributed along
with the Sunday newspaper to help you plan your TV watching
experience days ahead of time. In the <i>Q &amp; A</i>
section:

<blockquote><b>Q</b>: Are Bruce Dern and Bradford Dilman related? They have the same initials. - <i>B.L.P., Myrtle Creek, Ore</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>A</b>: Having the same initials is no
indication of a relationship. Those two are unrelated.</blockquote>

<p>This is, I think, admirable restraint on the part of
<b>A</b>...

<p>Second, from a recent (Oct 2) <i>New Yorker</i> humor
piece by Christopher Buckley, writing a "retrospective"
about the reasons why George W. Bush won the presidency. The
last one is:

<blockquote>Bush's October Surprise charge that Gore, a
Southerner, had owned slaves while he was a senator, though
demonstrably untrue, forced Gore to go off message during
the campaign's critical last days.</blockquote>

<p>Thinking about the "though demonstrably untrue" aside
is enough to send me into giggles.

<p>On the technology side, having to work with NT is enough
to send me into sustained grumpiness. (grumble grumble)
