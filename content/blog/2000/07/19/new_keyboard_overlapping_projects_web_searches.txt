<h1>New keyboard, overlapping projects, web searches</h1>

<p>Went down to DC for a couple days for work stuff. Looks
like we'll be rolling out the framework sooner than I
thought, and for a site I've been working on since mid-1995.
Neat.

<p> <p>When I got home the new Kinesis Ergo keyboard I
ordered
had arrived, and I'm using it now. It's very humbling to not
only have to teach my hands (and wrists, and fingers) what
do to again, but also to realize that certain motions I have
always done were, in the touch-typing sense, wrong. For
instance, since the keyboard is split into left- and
right-hand sides, I can't cheat anymore with the middle keys
(y and n, in particular) with the wrong hand. I also had a
tendency to chord certain uppercase letters with the same
hand -- definite no-no.

<p> <p>General typing speed (not using any funny characters,
just 'letter' typing is not bad after an hour or so of
practice. However, I suspect that many of the single-hand
chording incidences will appear when I start coding (perl)
in xemacs :)

<p>Also got a couple out-of-the-blue net things recently. <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/deusx/">deusx</a> sent an email and said he'd
heard about SPOPS and was curious if/how it overlapped with
Iaido. Since that isn't really discussed anywhere except
here, I assume that he found it through the diary entries.
It also lights a fire under my ass to actually release the
stuff as a proper project.

<p>And a fellow navy brat from my youth (as in 6 or 7 and
earlier, since our dads knew each other) was poking around
the web for her name (who hasn't done that? be honest) and
found a story I'd written which had her name it it. Funny.
Even funnier is that she lives in the D.C. area. Everyone
seems to pass through that place at some point in their
lives...
