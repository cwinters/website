<h1>Wedding photos up</h1>

Wedding photos are now online! I finally, finally started this up, and we're not even done. These photos were all taken by the excellent photographer Bob Cifone. I'll have a separate page for the best photos taken by the disposable cameras we had at the reception -- there were quite a few!

<p>I'll write some more later, but I just wanted to let everyone know. And adding new photos is really simple, since the thumbnail listing is dynamically generated. So check back for more photos -- we're about 1/3 of the way through the proof book... </p>
