<h1>Addictive personalities</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/bagder/">badger</a>: You should be happy
with the nokia monitor. I got the 445xi+ a few months ago
and absolutely love it. 1600 x 1200 is no problem, although
the monitor can do better, I think I'd go blind if I went
any higher.

<p>Do addictive personalities do addictive things all the
time, or just with certain things? For instance, after
getting the new everclear cd last week, I've probably
listened to it 30+ times, playing certain songs many times
in a row. Is it just that this CD happens to fit my mood
when I'm coding, or am I getting addicted? (Everclear: you
can't stop!) Gaming is similar: how many person-hours of
folks on advogato are getting sucked up by diablo 2? 

<p>This crossed my mind last night when a commercial came on
talking about a special on A &amp; E about gambing addiction. A
lot of the creepy addicts are the folks in front of slot
machines just yanking the lever like rats in an experiment,
waiting to get their pellet. I suppose the motivation
(making the big score) is the same when you get addicted to
poker or other games where you have to think a little (or a
lot), but slots are just so dehumanizing. Brr.

<p>At the same time, when I went to Las Vegas a few years
ago for comdex, I purposefully didn't do any gambling except
for placing a bet on the Steelers -- which I was able to
make a few bucks on, woo hoo! But in the back of my head I
thought that it would be in my personality to totally fall
into the trap they setup for you, spending all your waking
hours giving other people the money from the ATM machines
which are so conveniently setup, or from your credit cards,
draining whatever hope you have of planning your future. I
know there are people who can just do a little gambling, but
I have a hard time with potato chips!

<p>The other thing I'm getting addicted to is keeping up
with advogato diary entries.
