<h1>CGI trying framework, serious driving time</h1>

<p>Egads. Trying to port the framework not only to work
under CGI, but also to run on NT. What braindead IIS
engineer decided to tie STDERR to STDOUT? Unless you create
a $SIG{__WARN__} handler, all warn() and carp() (etc.) calls
are put out to the browser! And if you don't print out the
header first, the browser will either ask if you can
download the page or simply refuse to show it. What a pain.

<p>I will be <b>so</b> happy when mod_perl works on NT
without the current request serialization hassle.

<p>Lots of traveling last week to visit and for a wedding.
Driving 17 hours to florida (and 23 or so more successive
hours in the next few days) wasn't as bad as I thought :)
And it was actually nice to get away from email (etc.) for a
few days. Although it was a little difficult to get back
into the swing...
