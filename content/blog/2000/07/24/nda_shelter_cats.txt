<h1>NDA, shelter cats</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mrchrist">mrchrist</a>: I'm actually
running into this problem (free software development vs.
employment as a programmer) as a result of a rewritten NDA
that everyone at work was given. It's got some of the
standard stuff -- you can't take work that you do that the
company elsewhere being the pertinent one. I wondered what
would happen if we release(as planned) our web application
framework under the GPL/Artistic license. Would everyone be
able to work on it except me? The clause is written for
proprietary "stuff", whether that's software or oil-finding
hardware or whatever, and I wouldn't expect the lawyer who
drew it up to know about open source. So people are looking
into it, and the NDA is as yet unsigned...

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/skvidal/">skvidal</a>: I <b>highly
recommend</b> getting a cat, particularly from your local
shelter. Cats are very low maintenance, and generally sleep
when you're not around. (They also sleep when you are
around.) They can be wonderful companions, and my experience
has been that once I got a cat and lived with one for a
period of time, I could't imagine not living with one ever
again.
