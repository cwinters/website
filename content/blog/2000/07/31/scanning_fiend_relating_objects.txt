<h1>Scanning fiend, relating objects</h1>

<p>Scanning fiend this weekend. Got all the <a
href="http://www.cwinters.com/wedding/">wedding photos</a>
online, at least from the professional, and created step one
of a nifty photo browsing application. I probably have more
than 400 photos scanned in (old and new) and the only thing
stopping me from doing many, many more is the task of
organizing them. This project should take care of that.

<p>Faxmodem got fried in a rough electrical storm a few days
ago. I am <b>so</b> bummed about that. I suppose I'm lucky
that nothing happened to the DSL 'modem'....

<p>Cool stuff with the framework on friday -- talking stuff,
not implementing yet. But it should make navigation pretty
easy. One of the things we're shooting for with OpenInteract
is to make relating disparate things (documents, links,
events: SPOPS objects) simple,
and not require people to search. (It's weird: IME, normal
people never use the search functionality of a website.
Never.) Instead, the 'related items' will always be there.
Nielsen's 'Designing Web Usability' is a big proponent of
this, although that's not why we're doing it. :)

<p>Anyway, the idea is to keep the act of relating objects
in the hands
of the people who know what they're doing, make it easy for
them to do so, and let the information flow. (Kind of like
how yahoo ensured consistency by having one superorganized
MLS person who knew *everything*.)
