<h1>Initial new job impressions</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/jmg/">jmg</a>: Heaven knows I reinvent
the wheel
as much as the next person, but there seems to be a pretty
active project underway to replace CVS. See <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/Subversion/">Subversion</a>.

<p> <p>New job: going ok so far. I'm changing a ton of
things at
once: working in an office again (with more than a little
typical hacker anti-poltical-correctness), commuting,
learning about an entirely new realm of business problems,
figuring out how to use Win 2000 instead of Linux (hopefully
I'll be able to change this...), using an IDE for the first
time, and getting the ropes of Java along with lots of its
associated goop (EJB, JDBC, container this, entity bean
that, blah blah). It's kind of interesting and I'm sure the
Perl part of my brain will stay developed. But I already
miss Perl a little.
