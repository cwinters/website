<h1>Physical precision</h1>

<blockquote>The new physicality brought an unexpected element
into the act: precision. My routines wove the verbal with the
physical and I found pleasure trying to bring them in line. Each
spoken idea had to be physically expressed as well. My teenage
attempt at a magician's grace was being transformed into an
awkward comic grace. I felt as through every part of me was
working. Some nights it seemed that it wasn't the line that got
the laugh, but the tip of my finger. I tried to make voice and
posture as crucial as jokes and gags....Finally, I understood the
cummings quote I had puzzled over in college: "Like the burlesque
comedian, I am abormally fond of that precision which creates
movement." Precision was moving the plot forward, was filling
every moment with content, was keeping the audience engaged.
