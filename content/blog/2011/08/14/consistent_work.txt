<h1>Consistent work</h1>

<blockquote>The consistent work enhanced my act. I learned a
lesson: It was easy to be great. Every entertainer has a night
when everything is clicking. These nights are accidental and
statistical: Like lucky cards in poker, you can count on them
occurring over time. What was hard was to be <em>good</em>,
consistently good, night after night, no matter what the
abominable circumstances.</blockquote>
