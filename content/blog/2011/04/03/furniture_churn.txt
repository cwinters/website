<h1>Furniture churn</h1>

<p>Lots of furniture churn today.</p>

<p><b>Out</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dining room table and six chairs</li>
  <li>China closet</li>
  <li>Dining room light fixture (the first one I put up in the
  house, one of the few handy things I can do)</li>
  <li>Corner desk and chair (from the attic)</li>
  <li>Sofa table and side table (from the attic)</li>
  <li>Mica table lamp (from the attic)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>In:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Dining room table and four chairs (two left to
  assemble)</li>
  <li>Dining room light fixture (should be arriving Monday or
  Tuesday)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a pleasing imbalance.</p>

<p>More to come -- writing, not furniture. It's been missing for
a while, in more ways than one.</p>
