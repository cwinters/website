<h1>Impressions of Pittsburgh Geek Out Day</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/">Pittsburgh Geek Out
Day</a> on Saturday morning was very stimulating. It's an 
<a href="http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/home/open-spaces">open
spaces conference</a>, which essentially means the sessions, and
content within a session, are determined on the fly by the
participants. I think this was a little disconcerting at first
for some people but wound up working well.</p>

<p>I'd guess about two dozen people attended, which IMO is pretty
good for a first-time, Saturday-at-8:30-AM meeting. About 25% of
the attendees were from Summa, though they didn't explicitly
mention that. In fact, they took pains to separate their presence
from the event, not wanting people to assume this was some sort
of recruiting/advertising exercise. It certainly didn't feel that
way to me -- even the 'thanks' for the free bagels/juice/coffee
came at the very end.</p>

<p>The day started with an intro to the process, then people briefly
announced their discussion ideas before sticking them up on a
wall, proposing a time/room for it -- there were three timeslots
and three rooms, so only nine discussions. (The room distinction
was mostly irrelevant.)</p>

<p>I proposed three ideas with the intent that only one of them
would probably go in because lots of other people would chime
in. But the number of sessions wasn't as overwhelming as I
thought, and it turned out all three were on the schedule. This
was okay, but had the downside of missing other good
discussions. That's a normal side-effect of getting a number of
engaged and bright people together, but being a facilitator means
you can't use the "law of two feet" to explore another one.</p>

<p>The law of two feet is a simple thing -- if you're not getting
anything out of a discussion, nor are contributing to it, then
you have not only the option, but the <em>responsibility</em> to move
elsewhere. But its implications are much deeper. There's no
second-guessing about whether a topic is interesting or useful;
if not, people will change it or leave. </p>

<p>It's exhausting for me to determine whether people are into a
topic, or whether I'm talking too much, or not enough -- my
social antennae are stunted or something. So I found this a
wonderful constraint. It also strikes me as very <em>adult</em>, as in
you're treating your discussion colleagues as adults by allowing
them to make their own decisions.</p>

<p>The topics I attended weren't earth shattering, but wandered into
pretty meaty areas. The first was on managing distributed teams,
ostensibly with agile but we wound up discussing communication
and management problems in general, how different personalities
affect what you need to do, and a topic ('Cognitive Systems
Engineering') that I want to learn more about. There were only
three people in this one, but I felt like we could have talked
for another hour or two, easily. (More with beer.)</p>

<p>The second was on 'continuous deployment', a topic I'd
proposed. We spent a good bit of time on a couple of concrete
problems, which was excellent because it grounded the
discussion. One of the conclusions I had reinforced was that,
even if you cannot do continuous deployment, the act of trying to
create the process (lots of automation and streamlining) has good
results. Only four people in this one.</p>

<p>The last was on sharing technical and domain knowledge with your
team, though it really focused on the former. About 12 people in
this one, a lot of it around getting people up to speed (code
reviews/desk checks seemed to be the most mentioned method). </p>

<p>Overall, the day was just great. It was exhilarating talking with
people having the combination of: experience, useful reflection
on that experience, lack of ego, and the desire to learn more. I
look forward to more.</p>
