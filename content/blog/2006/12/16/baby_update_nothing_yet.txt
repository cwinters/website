<h1>Baby update: nothing yet...</h1>

<p>We're D+1 and no baby yet. It's a weird feeling, basically a couple weeks before the day you're psyching yourself up for the event, which can happen at any time. And a day goes by, another day, and another day... It's all mixed emotions: we're happy the baby's in there for the full term (at least the books say it's good), but we don't want him to be in there too long -- and we want to see the baby!</p>

<p>More later (hopefully soon).</p>
