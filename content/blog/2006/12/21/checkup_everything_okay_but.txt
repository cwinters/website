<h1>Checkup: everything okay, but...</h1>

<p>...still no baby. After declaring the movement and heart rate monitor outputs "Perfect," the OB told us this afternoon that if the ultrasound check didn't score 8 out of 8 that we wouldn't be leaving the hospital.</p>

<p>That ultrasound looked at movement, practice breathing, the amount of amniotic fluid and the heart rate, giving each a score of 0, 1 or 2 (2 being good). Fortunately, the baby scored 100% on its first test, so it's back to waiting. If the baby hasn't come by Tuesday we have another office visit, and while they didn't come out and say so directly I suspect that if they see the same signs as the did today, it's inducement time.</p>
