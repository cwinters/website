<h1>Petty politics and Santorum</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/290512227/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/102/290512227_8f9423e197_m.jpg" width="240" height="130" alt="Our neighbor's political placards" align="right" /></a>

<p>A few years ago I used to post a lot more about politics. Now, it's
not only exhausting and feels so futile, an entire class of people
have made it a full-time job. So my political ideas get relegated to
the choice of articles I <a
href="http://del.icio.us/cwinters/politics">bookmark</a>, along with
their comments.</p>

<p>That said, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone that I'm fairly
liberal. (I understand this may change with the arrival and rearing of
a kid. I'll take <a href="http://blandiose.org/">Derek's</a> lead on
that...) So I was happy to see these signs across the street on our
neighbor's lawn. Their leaning isn't surprising: if I had to guess, my
Pittsburgh neighborhood covers a decent swath of the middle class into
the working class. And Pittsburgh's a fairly liberal town on the
whole.</p>

<p>But the anti-Santorum one was a little unexpected. When the story
broke in <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04319/411623.stm">the
last couple years</a> about the Penn Hills school district getting
cheesed off because they had to pay for the Santorum kids' schooling,
I blew it off. I may not like the junior Senator from Pennsylvania,
but I think raising a family as a federal politician is hard enough as
it is that we can cut them a little slack. And it's a crummy tactic to
fault a parent for doing what he thinks best for his kids -- again, I
might not agree that cyber/home schooling is the way to go, but that's
his right as a parent.</p>

<p>Oddly, the story -- along with an obviously in-his-name residence
-- seems to leave a bitter taste with a lot of people. Enough so that
the Allegheny County Democrats created a 
<a href="http://www.payitbackrick.com/">posterboard website</a>, complete
with a "Meet the Press" YouTube excerpt of Tim Russert getting his
grill on with Santorum.</p>

<p>It's just so petty and ultimately meaningless. There are 
<a href="http://bucksforprogress.org/antisantorum.htm">so many other
things to dislike</a> about Santorum; can't we talk about those
instead?</p>
