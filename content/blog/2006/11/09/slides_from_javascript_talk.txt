<h1>Slides from JavaScript talk</h1>

<p>I gave a talk to the <a href="http://pgh.pm.org/">Pittsburgh Perl Mongers</a> tonight about JavaScript. So no, every talk doesn't need to be about Perl, although drawing references to perl constructs helps :-) Anyway, <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/raw/javascript_for_pghpm.pdf">here are the slides</a> (PDF, 1.5MB).</p>
