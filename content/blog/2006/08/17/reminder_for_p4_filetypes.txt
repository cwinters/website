<h1>Reminder for p4 filetypes</h1>

<p>You can tell Perforce to automatically mark certain files as type 'ktext', which is necessary to expand the RCS-like keywords. Unfortunately you have to do this on a per-depot basis[1] and I forget to do so when creating/using a new one. So this post is to remember two things:</p>
  
<ol>
  <li>The command for editing the mapping of depot + extension to file type is 'p4 typemap'; it's not anywhere that I saw in the Win32 GUI so don't even try looking.</li>
  <li>If you forget to add your filetype before importing a bunch of stuff, there's hope. <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/raw/p4_ktextify.pl"></li>
This perl script</a> will invoke the 'p4' command-line client to modify the filetype for those file extensions you specify. The only requirement is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IPC-Run/">IPC::Run</a>, which at least on ActivePerl is there by default.</li>
</ol>

<p>[1] Technically you don't have to (you can use the '//...' depot map) but if you're working in an org with many different development groups, some of which don't have much contact with one another, it's pretty rude to create a global type map.</p>
