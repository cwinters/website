<h1>Any way to find what URL patterns I match? (I == Servlet)</h1>

<p>I have an application where one servlet will respond to a request with a URL targeted to another servlet. Something like:</p>

<pre>
Client to Servlet 1:
  Can I get a new phone?
Servlet 1: 
  Sure; here's what you need to ask for (http://blah/phone/1234/)
Client to Servlet 2:
  Can I get 1234?
Servlet 2:
  Sure, here it is...
</pre>

<p>To do this it would be nice to either:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>have servlet 1 discover to what URL pattern(s) servlet 2 will respond</li>
  <li>have servlet 2 publish valid a URL pattern for outsiders creating URLs targeting it</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these require some sort of introspection on the servlet configuration, preferably at <tt>init()</tt>. But the URL pattern part of it just isn't there -- I can get my servlet name from the <tt>ServletConfig</tt> passed into <tt>init()</tt>, but I can't take that name and get additional information from the <tt>ServletContext</tt>. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>(I know that I could just declare the URL as an initialization parameter to either servlet 1 or 2, but then I'm declaring it twice. I also know that I could pull that parameter out into a configuration file and do some pre-processing of web.xml before deployment, but down that path is madness.)</p>
