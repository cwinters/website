<h1>Reading: Don't Make Me Think</h1>

<p>Some useful takeaways from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107/">Don't Make Me Think</a> (Steve Krug, 2000)[1]:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Title of the book doesn't mean that you should assume your users
 are stupid, just that what you provide them should be self-evident as
 should any actions they can take.</li>

<p>  <li>Making a user think exists in the large as well as in the
 small. For the former, providing a confusing and changing layout will
 force the user to think about every single action she takes. For the
 latter, using nonstandard terminology for standard actions makes her
 think just a half second -- for instance, using 'Quick Find' instead
 of 'Search'.</li>

<p>  <li>Consistency is key. For instance, if a user clicks on a link for a
 resident that says 'Robert Rodriguez' and gets to a page titled
 'Resident Actions' with only summary information about the resident
 in a small red bar at the top, we're making her think.</li>

<p>  <li>People don't read instructions, so don't even provide them. Cut
 your text in half, then cut it in half again.</li>

<p>  <li>People muddle through without reasoning a rational explanation of
 what they're doing or why it's progressing the way it is.</li>

<p>  <li>People rarely (approaching never) use the paths through your site 
 that you expect, and you need to design it such that someone can look 
 at a page and figure out what it's for, what they can do with it, and 
 how to get around the rest of the site.</li>

<p>  <li>Make 'clickable things' obviously clickable; creating a design for
 subtlety won't work, unless (maybe) you're designing a site whose
 sole audience is graphic designers.</li>

<p>  <li>Krug's second law of usability: "It doesn't matter how many times I
 have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous
 choice."</li>

<p>  <li>Testing is crucial and is valuable even in small doses, even if you
 only do a little of it. Focus groups are okay, but a one-on-one
 videotaped encounter with a user trying to get certain tasks done
 with your site is best. He has a script of how such an encounter
 might progress.</li>

<p>  <li>Before-and-after examples are really useful, where he takes a
 site's page, explains what's wrong with it and then creates a new
 page in response.</li>

<p></ul>

<p>Other stuff:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Focus is on e-commerce sites circa 2000, which means a lot of
  current technology (like AJAX) doesn't come into play. <br />
  <ul>
    <li>It also means you get to see the pets.com and flooz sites again!)</li>

<p>    <li>It also means you there's a good amount of text that doesn't
    translate well to an internal application built for a dedicated
    (work-time) audience. For instance, the chapter on what goes into
    the home page is mostly irrelevant.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>[1] I just noticed while digging up the link for this post that a second 
edition was published last year: doh! I don't know how much it's changed.</p>
