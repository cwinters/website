<h1>Removing 'My Bluetooth Places': piece of cake!</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://pressf1.pcworld.co.nz/archive/index.php/t-52294.html">PC World Forums:</a>

<blockquote>To Remove the "My Bluetooth Places" icon from desktop, simply right click on desktop and then go to properties/desktop/customize desktop/clean desktop now. Then tick the box: "My Bluetooth Places" and press next. The icon should then be in a folder called unused desktop items on your desktop. You can then delete the folder if you wish too, it's that easy.</blockquote>

<p>Is it possible that any nomal human would discover this on their own? On a Mac, you know what the instructions would be? "Drag the icon to the trash." It would Just Work.</p>
