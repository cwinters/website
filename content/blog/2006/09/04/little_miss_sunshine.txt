<p>Barb and I saw this Saturday night at the Destinta, just wanting to
get out of the house. (Note to self: they have an air hockey table.)
It's offbeat with a small 'o' -- not trying too hard to be weird. Just
because he's become such a BMOC I expected a larger role from Steve
Carrell, but he's very much supporting, and doesn't angst as much as
you'd expect for someone who, as the movie opens, has just
unsuccessfully tried to kill himself.</p>

<p>Some really, really funny scenes and touching performances. Parts
of it are classic American Road Movie, which I like. Also a brief and,
I think, unintentionally creepy look at little girl beauty
pageants. They also don't hit you over the head three times so you
understand every little detail. Recommended.</p>
