<h1>Fun Friday at work: Office Space</h1>

<p>I haven't been posting much at all lately, much less anything about work. I hope to fix that soon. But to start off, something fun. We set aside a couple hours on Friday afternoon around lunch to watch the classic <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> on a big wall-mounted TV in a conference room. Our excuse for watching? One of the folks on the team hadn't seen it before.</p>

<p>And we got free pizza to boot, how can you beat that? Good times, good times. <br clear="all" /></p>
