<h1>About Jackson's tail</h1>

<p>The vet told us that the lump on Jackson's tail was just a
fluid-filled cyst, and not to worry about it unless it grew or became
too heavy for him to hold his tail up. Jackson had a fairly long tail
and the lump was about in the middle.</p>

<p>So we ignored it for a while, checking it every once in a while to
make sure it wasn't getting bigger. He flicked his tail back and forth
as if the lump weren't there, as normal, so we didn't worry. You can
sort of see the lump in this photo:</p>

</p>

<p>Then one night a few weeks ago, he walked into the living room with his tail up at the base but
bent in the middle, like a paper clip. We made an appointment for him
at the vet. It wasn't good news: the lump was probably
cancerous. However, they said tumors in the tail are usually a fairly benign and
static type, so, again, we didn't have much to worry about. They'd
have to remove the tumor, which could mean they'd have to
amputate his tail.</p>

<p>This made us a little sad. Jackson has always had a very long tail
in proportion to his body:</p>

</p>

<p>...even when he was a kitten:</p>

</p>

<p>We were sad because, while we wanted him to be healthy, you never
know what value cats place on their tails. They seem like very
vain animals (as much as they can be) so I figure it would be like
losing your nose or something: you'd survive, but you might not feel
like the same person.</p>

<p>His surgery went well, but they did have to amputate his tail, and
the vet sent a piece of the tumor to a pathologist to make sure it was
the type he expected. We brought him home and he seemed pretty up, despite
having a bandage on his tail:</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>He roamed around the house as normal and didn't seem to bother his
bandage much. (The vet told us to watch out for that because cats were
notorious for picking at their tails if something was on them.) That
lasted a whole day: Thursday night before turning in I went looking
for him to make sure he was okay, but before finding him I saw a
bandage without a tail sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>Uh oh.</p>

<p>Jackson was stalking the next room, back and forth, and when his
unencumbered tail his something he'd flinch a little bit but keep on going.</p>

<p>I should explain here that the vet used metal sutures to keep his
tail closed. He'd used this successfully on many cats before because
they tend not to chew on them. (He explained later it would be like
you or me gnawing on a clothes hanger. So the end of his half-shaved tail looked like some sort of
medieval weapon, with metal spikes sticking out. (No photos, sorry.)</p>

<p>The wound had oozed a little
blood but it wasn't actively running. We tried to bandage it back up
but he was too ornery, so we took him to a vet that we thought was
open 24/7. We got there five minutes before closing (midnight) and, in
hindsight, staff clearly wasn't happy about doing this work even
though they would've charged an arm and a leg for it.</p>

<p>One of the vets looked at his tail and said the sutures were still in good shape and should be
fine until morning when we could take him to our normal vet. To
prevent him from chewing he got a stiff plastic collar, and we took
him home.</p>

<p>After settling down we closed him in our room and went to bed, only
to be awoken a half-hour later by a fierce cry. Barb turned on the
lights and he was running around the bed, trailing blood. We'd later
find out he ripped out and swallowed one of his sutures (it showed up
very clearly on the x-ray). So we found a 24/7 animal hospital and
rushed him over there, wrapped in a red towel and crying much of the
way.</p>

<p>Ninety minutes later (now about 3:30) he had a new bright green puffy bandage
that the vet said should be fine overnight. He was a little suspicious
of the metal sutures because he hadn't seen them on a tail before, and
warned that the skin at the end of the tail had ruptured and that
they'd probably have to take another vertebrae from the end of the
tail to close it up properly. He said they'd be able to do the work if our normal vet wasn't, but they'd probably charge twice as much.</p>

<p>So Barb took him the next morning and, despite it not being a surgery day, they called in the vet who
typically does surgeries to re-operate. They were able to close the
tail up without taking any more off, and used normal sutures instead
of the metal ones.</p>

<p>By the time we picked him from his second surgery up the pathologist's report had come
back.</p>

<p>More bad news: instead of being the benign tumor they'd
expected, it was actually an agressive type of tumor called an
osteosarcoma (bone cancer). The vet -- who may have started practicing before I was born -- was very puzzled at this because
he'd never seen this type of tumor in a tail: typically it starts in
one of the legs which then need to be amputated to stop the
growth. It's also apparently more common in dogs than in cats.</p>

<p>So while the pathologist's prognosis came back as "guarded to poor"
the vet said he wasn't that pessimistic since they were able to
amputate and he didn't see it on the x-ray anywhere else in the
body.</p>

<p>In the intervening time he's done pretty well, getting one
scheduled bandage change (no photos) and then an unscheduled one
because he was picking at the previous bandage. His tail now looks
like a Dupont Circle fireplug because of the pink bandage at the
end:</p>

</p>

<p>And as you can see he's got a collar now, which he absolutely
<b>loves</b>. It doesn't entirely prevent him from picking, but it
prevents the casual, "Hey what's that?" ones stemming from cats having almost no memory.</p>

<p>So now we wait and see and hope he's okay.</p>
