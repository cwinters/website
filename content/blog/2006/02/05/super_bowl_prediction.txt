<h1>Super Bowl prediction</h1>

<p>Since Pudge <a href="http://use.perl.org/~pudge/journal/28573">offered up his prediction</a> I will too: Pittsburgh 31, Seattle 19. And like Indiannapolis and Denver the game won't be that close. Unfortunately this score means I won't win the office pool (I think I have AFC 3, NFC 2), but it's possible I'll hit the score at a quarter's end.</p>
