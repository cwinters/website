<h1>Do I know anyone in San Diego?</h1>

<p>I'll be in San Diego next week (Sun-Thu) for the gigantic <a href="http://www.himss06.org/">HIMSS</a> conference.* Off the top of my head I can't remember anyone who lives there, but then again I don't know where many online people live. So if you want to have a beer or something shoot me an email.</p>
