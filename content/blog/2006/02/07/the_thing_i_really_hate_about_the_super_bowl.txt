<h1>The thing I really hate about the Super Bowl</h1>

<p>...is that everybody is now using the stupid phrase "ticky-tack". Where the hell did this come from? Did everyone just take a pill that reverted their vocabulary to a six-year old's?</p>

<p>(I had a somewhat similar reaction to the word '<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3453">chippy</a>' about a month ago, so a possible and rational explanation is that I'm just turning into an old fart.)</p>
