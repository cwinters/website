<h1>JetBrains Team Server</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TW/Team+Server+Home">JetBrains Team Server</a>: "...a distributed build management system that allows running and monitoring
build process and facilitates integration of changes."</p>

<p>IIRC it was originally to be Java-only, but it appears multiplatform now. I wonder if you'll be able to create your own build agents...</p>

<p>Anyway, looks pretty nifty and it's in EAP. No idea about final cost.</p>
