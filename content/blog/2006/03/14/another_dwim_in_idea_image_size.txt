<h1>Another DWIM in IDEA: image size</h1>

<p>In addition to being a fantastic Java IDE, IDEA is a pretty sharp XML/HTML editor. It understands DTDs and schemas and is able to apply its autocomplete and in-time validation to these documents just as it does with Java source. And the  editor for some XML documents have refactoring smarts built-in as well -- Shift-F6 (Rename) on an Ant variable will rename it throughout the file. (I wouldn't be surprised if it did so in files called by the Ant build script either.)</p>

<p>So while editing some Javadoc I stuck in an image link. IDEA found the image for me: in the src attribute I typed 'd' then Ctrl-space, '/', then Ctrl-space again and it found the only PNG file there. Easy enough.</p>

<p>But then I typed 'height' and thought, "I wonder if it'll autofill this...". So I followed with Ctrl-space and, sure enough, the image height popped in. Same with the width. Nice!</p>

<p>Obviously the technology behind this isn't astounding, it's just one of the nice little surprises where Jetbrains' attention to detail reveals itself.</p>

<p>(It just occurred to me that I've posted two items in a row about Jetbrains. Just a coincidence, honest.)</p>
