<h1>Neal Adams, more than comics?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.nealadams.com/">Neal Adams</a> is a legendary comic book artist. But I learned today he's an amateur scientist as well, one who thinks that Earth (and all the other planets) are <a href="http://www.nealadams.com/nmu.html">expanding</a>. He recently did a <a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/03/16.html">radio show</a> about it (haven't listened to it yet). Weird juxtaposition for me.</p>
