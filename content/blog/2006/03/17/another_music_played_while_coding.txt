<h1>Another music played while coding</h1>

<p>An endless topic among developers is, "What music do you listen to while coding?" So here's my latest entry -- disc 2 of Moby's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007CZPIS/">Hotel</a>. It's all ambient, no spoken words, and fits very nicely into the background. Music with words winds up getting me distracted when trying to concentrate on something else.</p>

<p>My previous favorite in this type of music was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000069CI/">Music  for Airports</a>, Bang on a Can doing Brian Eno. Jeremy Zawodny mentioned this as good coding music a while back, and I found the disc on the South Side shop on Carson around 12th street, whatever that's called.</p>
