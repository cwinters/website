<h1>del.icio.us feeds not updating?</h1>

<p>It seems like RSS feeds from del.icio.us aren't updating, and there's nothing mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/">relevant blog</a> about it. Just thought I'd bring it up.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: standard feed seems to be okay now, not sure about the <tt>for:</tt> items Chris mentions in a comment.</p>
