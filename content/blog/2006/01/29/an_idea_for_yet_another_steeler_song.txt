<h1>An idea for yet another Steeler song</h1>

<p>I'm kinda surprised nobody's used the Johnny Cash song "Hey Porter" (snippet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BISBDY/">here</a>) to an ode to Joey Porter, who has been tearing it up in the playoffs. There's a bunch of songs out there, including <a href="http://sullysstuff.blogspot.com/2006/01/sunday-steeler-sunday.html">this crazy one</a> about someone mispronouncing Troy Polamalu's name. (Link in post, I don't like posting links directly to songs.)</p>

<p>Anyway, "Hey Porter" is a simple song and should be easy to come up with some verses:</p>
  
<pre>
Hey Porter, hey porter
Would you sack Hasselback again
Alexander's coming up the middle
And needs to be put on his head
...
</pre>
