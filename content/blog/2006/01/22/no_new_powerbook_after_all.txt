<h1>No new powerbook after all</h1>

<p>Discretion got the better part of greed and I'll be holding off on a new Powerbook for a while. (Plus we had to drop more money on our cat than I expected, more on that soon.) I'll let early adopters like <a href="http://mark.denovich.org/">Mark</a> tease out all the bugs :-) So to bridge the gap I ordered a GB DIMM from <a href="http://www.crucial.com/">crucial</a> today, which should make things much snappier. (IDEA isn't terribly happy with large projects and 512 MB...) Hopefully this one will work better with 10.4 than <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3371">my earlier one</a> did...</p>
