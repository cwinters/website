<h1>Chippy?</h1>

Have I just been missing the word 'chippy' for years, or did it just pop up? (Meaning: spirited play of the pushing and shoving variety.) I heard Tunch say it a few times on the radio during tonight's game, and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs05/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=2284955">two</a> <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs05/columns/story?columnist=jackson_tom&id=2285183">different</a> ESPN stories referencing the game had it as well. Maybe they both heard the local broadcast and figured they were missing out?
