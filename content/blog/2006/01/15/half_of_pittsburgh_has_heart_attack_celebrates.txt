<h1>Half of Pittsburgh has heart attack, celebrates</h1>

I cannot remember a football game like the one this afternoon. The great interception called back in an awful call, the fumble by Bettis at the end could make the most hardened skeptic into a believer of doomed fate. And the rock-solid kicker missing (by a ton!) at the end? Storybook, storybook.
