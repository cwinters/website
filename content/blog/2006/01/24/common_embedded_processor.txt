<h1>Common embedded processor</h1>

<p>James posted a photo of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/90855631/">Linux on a Treo</a>, and of course one of the items in the screenshot is the results of <tt>cat /proc/cpuinfo</tt>. I was weirdly pleased to see that the Treo has the same CPU (PXA270) as our <a href="http://www.vocollect.com/global/web/en/pr/vocollect_continues_innovation_in_voice_directed_work_with_talkman_t5">recently-released</a> version of the Talkman: the <a href="http://www.vocollect.com/en/offerings/wearable_computers.php">T5</a>. (IMO, neat flash demo follows.)</p>
