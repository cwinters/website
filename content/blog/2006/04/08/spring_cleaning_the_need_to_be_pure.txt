<h1>Spring cleaning: The need to be pure</h1>

<p>I'm cleaning out some started blog posts from my desktop. This one was started from February and has just been sitting there, taunting my lazy ass.</p>

<p>So a controversy is erupting over a gay man playing a central role
in a film, <a href="http://www.endofthespear.com/">End of the Spear</a>, about Christian
missionaries in South America and produced by a explicitly Christian
studio. 
<a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/news/chadallen.html">Apparently</a>,
when offering him the contract the studio didn't know the actor, Chad
Allen, was gay. On learning this fact they "felt obligated to honor it
[the contract]", and even when Allen offered to withdraw they
refused.</p>

<p>Some Christians are incensed by this. In particular, <a
href="http://nossobrii.blogspot.com/">Kevin
Bauder</a> in two blog posts (<a
href="http://nossobrii.blogspot.com/2006/01/no-way.html">Jan 13</a> and
<a href="http://nossobrii.blogspot.com/2006/01/answer.html">Jan
16</a>).</p>

<p>It's interesting to read the comments on these. In the first
there's one from 'Linda' that's unusual for asking the WWJD question
thoughtfully instead of rhetorically -- sorry for the long quote, 
but I think it's worth preserving whole:</p>

<blockquote>Hello. I am Linda, a newbie. I know this is a little
extreme for my first message. But please bear with me, as I believe
that this has to be said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am incredibly disappointed with your views regarding the casting of
Chad Allen, a gay activist, in "End of the Spear". While I agree that
homosexuality is a sin and that Chad needs Jesus Christ, I do not see
how his homosexuality and his views on this lifestyle will affect the
movie. Not only that, but I believe that it is hypocritical of some
professing Christians to complain about the fact that he is in the
movie. It's as though you and the others who are complaining have
forgotten that Jesus Christ died to save ALL sinners, including
homosexuals like Chad Allen. The way you're acting, it's like you
believe that your sins are forgivable, but homosexuality is
not. Remember: there is only one unforgivable sin, and that is
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(I apologize if this came out harsher than I intended. I'm not trying
to be mean or anything. I just want to get my point across. I don't
want you to think that I'm bashing you or anything like that.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>I didn't even know that Chad Allen was gay until I came across a
thread on a message board. I don't believe that his homosexuality will
harm the film. In fact, this sin isn't even mentioned in the film. Not
only that, but I truly do believe that God allowed Mr. Allen to be
cast in this movie so he would be given the opportunity to hear the
gospel and to learn about the love of Christians, as well as the love
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The mere fact that Chad accepted
the role after he learned that he'd be playing a Christian missionary
is, to me, a miracle. I truly believe that God is tugging on
Mr. Allen's heart, and that He began doing so on the day when Chad was
offered the roles of Nate and Steve Saint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>God always places us in situations, either directly or indirectly,
where we are given chances to hear the gospel. Perhaps that's what He
did with Mr. Allen. Personally, I am more concerned about Chad's
spiritual fate than I am with whether or not a gay actor should have
been cast in a Christian film.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After reading Mart Green's comments in regards to this issue, my
belief that God wanted Chad to be in this film is strengthened. Not
only that, but as I was watching the movie, Mr. Allen's homosexuality
didn't even cross my mind. I was more concerned with the message of
the movie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The only problem I have with Chad being in the movie is the fact that
he was cast in dual roles. I don't understand why he ended up playing
both Nate Saint and Steve Saint. What's up with that? I listened to
the narrator, and I knew it was Chad Allen. But I didn't understand
why he ended up playing Nate AND Steve. Very confusing. But in any
case, I thought he did an excellent job playing both roles. Very
moving performances by all, in fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I believe that it is important for all Christians to watch this movie,
because it is a sobering reminder of the sacrifices that we may have
to make during our service to God. Granted, most of us will probably
not be martyred. But who's to say that our loved ones will be spared?
I believe this movie is incredibly important, and it's a shame that
people like you are allowing Chad Allen's homosexuality to prevent you
from watching a film with such an important message. In fact, I plan
on telling my Christian friends to watch this movie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you truly believe that no sinner should take part in a Christian
film...Well, doesn't that mean that there would be no Christian films?
And have you forgotten that God uses ANYONE for His purposes?</blockquote>

<blockquote>I believe that you are entitled to your opinions. However, I do not
support your view of the casting of Mr. Allen in this movie. I love
you, brother. But I feel that you are just plain wrong. Not only that,
but I believe that these views will be used by gay activists against
all Christians, because they will believe that your opinions come from
hatred for them and not just for their actions. I think you need to do
a little more praying for Chad Allen and a little less complaining
about the fact that he was cast in a Christian film.</blockquote>

<p>So the people wanting to boot the actor feel it would be hypocritical to 
keep the sinner on board; others feel it would be hypocritical to boot him
because we're all sinners.</p>

<p>We encounter the need to be pure -- or non-hypocritical -- all the time. 
I call myself a vegetarian but I eat milk, eggs and fish. People of different types get upset
by this -- some vegans think this a betrayal, some omnivores gleefully point this out
to point out my inconsistency. But one person's taintedness is another's 
consistency -- I wouldn't mind collecting milk or eggs, or killing a fish, for
my dinner. I'd have a problem doing that with a lamb, pig or cow. So I'm not asking
someone to do something I wouldn't do myself.</p>

<p>But that sounds like a rationalization, doesn't it? The need to keep my own actions
in a consistent state. Why is this so important? Is this an American thing? Does the
fundamental idea behind puritanism linger into whatever we do?</p>
