<h1>Muddying what "embedded java" means</h1>

<p>Okay, so in the Java world there's:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition), just a collection of specifications and APIs using J2SE to manage lots of stuff.</li>
  <li>J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition), your basic Java</li>
  <li>J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition), which includes different configurations for devices of different capabilities -- why they made these look/sound so similar is beyond me:
  <ul>
     <li>CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration), for limited devices like cell phones</li>
     <li>CDC (Connected Device Configuration) for more capable devices, like maybe a networked storage appliance or a phone/PDA </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So now Sun is adding:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/embedded/index.jsp">J2SE  Embedded</a>, which is...? (More discussion <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3021107563.html">on LinuxDevices</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't quite tell what J2SE Embedded actually means -- maybe it's a series of custom builds with optional graphical capabilities? Maybe it just means that Sun will be offering it alongside their normal releases? Is it differentiated from J2ME/CDC in that only 'big computer' processors will be supported? (That is, no XScale, MIPS, etc.) Chould be interesting...</p>
