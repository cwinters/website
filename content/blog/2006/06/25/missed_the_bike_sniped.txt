<h1>Missed the bike, sniped!</h1>

<p>I'm outside Cincinnati for our <a href="http://reunion.kirkwinters.com/"">family reunion</a> and I was sitting in a hotel watching the auction for <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7250819198&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&rd=1">my future new bike</a> winding down....</p>

<p>...three minutes, still high, a comfortable $140 cushion between my max and the current amount.</p>

<p>...two minutes, still high, imagining flying up the Allegheny College hill on the end of the MS150 first day.</p>

<p>...one minute, still high, wondering how fast I could get the included computer.</p>

<p>...thirty seconds, still high, thinking of the other stuff we need the money for.</p>

<p>...fifteen seconds -- dammit, outbid five seconds earlier!</p>

<p>I flashed through bumping it up, but that's a dangerous path. My max was my max, and I stuck with it. But: no bike. Ahh well.</p>
