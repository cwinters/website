<h1>Considering REST</h1>

<p>One of the reasons I haven't been posting much is that I've been
nose-deep in my 
<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3493">"new" job</a>
learning about the new domain, nursing homes. We're getting our arms
around the problemspace to the point where we're coming up with some
(IMO) really innovative ways to do a mix of voice-directed work (what
our core business does) with self-directed-by-voice work (more
applicable to healthcare and other domains). But I'm not going to talk
about that, it's kinda sensitive ;-)</p>

<p>More recently I've been nose-deep in thinking about how to
architect the new server-side system. For various reasons it needs a
rethink + rewrite rather than some polishing. And yes, I'm very aware
of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second system effect</a>
that can plague such efforts.</p>

<p>When you get into healthcare IT (even tangentially with an area
like long-term care) one of the things you quickly realize is the
tension in being "interoperable".[1] Users want it because they want
all information about a patient or her care to be authoritative, and
they don't want to enter it twice or have to translate it to different
formats (paper) for different departments. Vendors want it
because... well, actually AFAICT they don't want it. They only say
they want it because users want it. But interoperability, like
obscentity, means different things to different people. Vendor A
claims to be interoperable because they support web services for basic
patient information; Vendor B claims to be interoperable because they
support an ancient data exchange standard that nobody actually uses
anymore; Vendor C because they "use XML".</p>

<p>At least mainstream healthcare has the federal government 
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/technology/economic_policy200404/chap3.html">breathing down its neck</a> 
to force the issue, although it's uncertain if that's a hollow
mandate. But long-term care seems to be even further behind in
standard interoperability, which creates a sticky situation for your
humble developer: How to create a system that must integrate with
other systems without knowing in advance what those other systems
are?</p>

<p>One way is to join a standards body (like 
<a href="http://hl7.org/">HL7</a>), influence the standard and then beat
everyone over the head with it. It's possible if you're Microsoft or IBM, but
probably not if you're us. And even if we were a big player we'd have
to start from near ground-zero (see any "Long-Term Care" SIG 
<a href="http://hl7.org/Special/committees/index.cfm?SRC=hl7sigs.htm">here</a>?). 
And even if were weren't starting from scratch, standards move at a
glacial pace (particularly in healthcare) and have the annoying
property of having other people involved.</p>

<p>Another way is to make integration as simple as possible. Using a
few basic principles, try to model your data as easily grokked
resources and figure out how they can be retrieved and manipulated. If
external systems can do the small amount of work to talk to your
system directly, great! If they can't, at least your integration task
is a small amount of glue instead of starting from scratch with every
system -- that is, what you have to change with every new integration
is much smaller because most of the hard work is done for you.</p>

<p>Thus, HTTP + <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage">REST</a>. Every modern system can speak HTTP -- I bet even Excel spreadsheets
can issue HTTP calls. And I think REST can be a nice companion to a
good data model decomposition. (I'm not sure about that since I'm
right in the middle of doing it.) It's true that by going this vs
SOAP/XML-RPC we're giving up the built-in infrastructure for service
discovery and automatic code generation systems based on those
services (UDDI + WSDL + your-favorite-IDE). But despite its first
initial, SOAP isn't simple, and I think keeping your data messages as
close to your data model as possible (vs. using generic
representations) can be a good idea. (Mapping documents are something
else to keep in sync.)</p>

<p>Another part of making integration simple is to not make it
separate. If you have a service layer for external users and another
layer for your own applications, the service layer will always get out
of date. Inevitably, you'll only learn that it's gotten out of date
when you have a quick-turnaround integration to do and you'll have to
scramble doubletime to get it back in sync.</p>

<p>So why not use your own external data access for everything? The
mainstreaming of AJAX and the slew of 
<a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Frameworks">frameworks</a> available means you've got higher-level building blocks to work
with. So why not get out of the business of merging (X)HTML templates
+ data on the server and do it all on the browser?</p>

<p>(I was going to add some stuff here about HTTP plus
publish/subscribe messaging, but this is long enough already and I
think that subject deserves its own post.)</p>

<p>I haven't made up my mind about this architecture yet and I need to
bounce it off some more brains here, but the more I think about it and
the more I think of use scenarios, the more the simplicity works in
its favor. We'll see if it holds up in some quick prototyping.</p>

<p>[1] I am a rank newbie in this area and I recognize the tension, so I figure
everyone else does too. But I could be misreading the situation.</p>
