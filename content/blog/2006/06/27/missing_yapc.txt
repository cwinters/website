<h1>Missing YAPC</h1>

<p>I'm bummed I wasn't able to get to <a href="http://yapcchicago.org/">Chicago</a> this year. (I'm going on a work trip in a few hours.) The talks may or may not have been interesting, but I really miss catching up with all the folks from years past. With beer.</p>

<p>I hope things are running smoothly and that That Guy isn't screwing up anybody's talks!</p>
