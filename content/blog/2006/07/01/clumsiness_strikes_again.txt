<h1>Clumsiness strikes again!</h1>

<p>While finishing what was IMO a pretty decent job of trimming the unruly bush/tree out front I stepped back onto the ledge of the concrete step edge, twisted my ankle and came down, hard, on my ass then shoulder on the steps. Eight hours later it doesn't seem too bad, just a twist instead of a sprained ankle -- I've sprained both my ankles multiple times over the last 20 years so I can tell the difference. And it's not swelling like a balloon, nice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it ruined what was to be the first nice day I was home and not wiped out from crappy air travel to try out the road bike I borrowed from Mark. Conspiracy?</p>
