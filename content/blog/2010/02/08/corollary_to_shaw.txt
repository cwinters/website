<h1>Corollary to Shaw's unreasonable man</h1>

<blockquote>
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable
one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore
all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
<br />
George Bernard Shaw

<blockquote>
Corollary: Sometimes the unreasonable man is just a prick.
