<h1>Hiring two Java developers</h1>

<p>We're <a
href="http://tbe.taleo.net/NA4/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=VOCOLLECT&amp;cws=1&amp;rid=490">hiring two Java developers</a> 
to <a href="http://www.accunurse.com/">my team in Pittsburgh</a>!</p>

<p>Some non-HR skinny about us:</p>

<ul>

 <li>We are a small and empowered team. There is no committee
 that decides whether you can start using Google Guava to make
 things better.</li>

 <li>We get to do meaningful things -- this is not "shovel CRUD
 onto the web" type of work. We change the lives of people living
 and working in skilled nursing facilities.</li>

 <li>Java experience is a must. Yes, you can learn a language
 really quickly, but that's the easy part. Absorbing the
 libraries and the ecosystem takes a lot of time.</li>

 <li>We have a lot of work to do, but we don't burn ourselves out
 doing it.</li>

 <li><p>You will probably[1] have a leg-up if you've got any of the
 following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>some UI design and implementation chops,</li>
    <li>deep understanding of JavaScript the language,</li>
    <li>use of Spring in anger (double word score for 3.0),</li>
    <li>knowledge of healthcare data interchange (HL7),</li>
    <li>working knowledge of unix systems.</li>
  </ul>

 </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="mailto:chris@cwinters.com">Let me know</a> if you're
interested, or if I can fill you in on more details.</p>

<p>[1] Speaking for myself and not for the rest of the potential
interviewing team...</p>
