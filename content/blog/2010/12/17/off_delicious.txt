<h1>Off delicious...</h1>

<p>Given <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/">recent
news</a>, my bookmarks are now going into pinboard. Here are the
details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Username: cwinters</li>
  <li><a href="http://pinboard.in/u:cwinters">Web page</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pinboard.in/rss/u:cwinters">RSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike some others I'm not that upset about delicious going
away. I liked it and used it extensively (5600+ bookmarks since
April 2004), but it's a commodity. The fact that they made the
bookmarks so easy to export in a standard format speaks to this
as well.</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of the delicious hubbub is trust. Even
if Yahoo sells the service to someone else, sufficient trust has
been lost that people aren't likely to come back. Cloud services
like this feel more susceptible to losing trust than apps housed
locally. The ease of using the service also means it's easy to
use a competing service, as long as you can move your data --
particularly one as lightweight as delicious. Is the same true of
a hosted electronic medical record? Probably not to the same
degree, but trust still something vendors have to zealously
protect.</p>
