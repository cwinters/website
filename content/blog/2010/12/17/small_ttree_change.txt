<h1>Small ttree config change fixes site</h1>

<p>When I got my new laptop I reinstalled a bunch of perl
modules, tending to do it on an as-needed basis vs the autobundle
reload. ("What bothers you about that, the ease, the
convenience...?" Anyway.) And it loaded a new version of the Template
Toolkit. Apparently between the version on my old laptop and this
one a number of changes had been made to <tt>ttree</tt>, which <a
href="http://www.cwinters.com/blog/2008/07/08/new_site.html">generates
this site</a>. And when I ran my publishing script it dutifully
generated the Atom feed, put the new post on the front page,
and uploaded it to the site.</p>

<p>But I got an email from someone that the actual permalink
resulted in a 404. A little closer looking found that <tt>ttree</tt>
wasn't generating my files! I vaguely remembered having to patch
ttree and looked around for a post on that, no luck. Turning on
verbose mode ('verbose = 2') in <tt>ttree.cfg</tt> showed this:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@abita ... $ ttree -f ./ttree.cfg
ttree 2.9 (Template Toolkit version 2.22)

      Source: content
 Destination: site
Include Path: [ templates ]
      Ignore: [  ]
        Copy: [ \.(css|js|html|xml|atom)$, ^robots\.txt$ ]
      Accept: [ \.txt$ ]
      Suffix: [ txt =&gt; html ]
     Summary: 
            0 files processed
            0 files copied
            0 directories created
            2 files skipped (not modified)
           21 files skipped (ignored)
</pre>

<p>Hmm... that number of files skipped is really low. A little
more checking revealed that I needed to explicitly specify
recursive behavior, with 'recurse = 1'. Everything is now as it
should be, and now that I don't need to patch <tt>ttree</tt>
no more surprises should pop-up.</p>
