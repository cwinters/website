<h1>Ella's first visits out</h1>

<p>On Tuesday Ella had her first <a href="http://www.pediatricssouth.com/">doctor's</a> appointment. She <b>loves</b> the car, which was expected from the reports of other people with babies. And we're getting more experirenced at getting her in and out of the car seat.</p>

<p>Her appointment went well -- she gained back all but one ounce of her birth weight, having gone from 10 lbs 1 oz at birth, to 9 lbs 8 oz a day later, to 9 lbs 3 oz the day after that. But apparently babies don't gain back their birth weight for 10-14 t, and she did it in five. So for the all-important percentiles: 95 for height (21.75 inches), 97 for head circumference and 97 for weight. So the feeding is going well.</p>

<p>We also went to the local Babies R Us to trade in some newborn outfits that don't fit her and I carried her in the car seat. She slept the entire time. Last night (Thursday) we made another trip there -- it's becoming like Home Depot -- and also visited Macy's to trade in another outfit that didn't fit. She was great the entire time.</p>

<p>At night she's pretty good -- last night was great: Barb woke Ella up a few times during the night, fed her, and then was able to put her back to sleep. A CD we picked up with white noise-y sounds helped -- vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, restaurants, etc. I think I'm going to start associating vacuums with sleep from now on.</p>
