<h1>I'm going to the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop, are you?</h1>

<p>The second <a href="http://www.pghpw.org/">Pittsburgh Perl Workshop</a> is this weekend, and twice as long as it was last year! There are lots of great talks lined up and even a full day opportunity to <a href="http://pghpw.org/ppw2007/zerotoperl.html">get your Perl learn on</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you're not really a Perl person this is a fun time. My Perl status is grandfathered in from earlier jobs and projects so the talks aren't directly relevant to my job. But hanging out with a bunch of smart people together with ideas zipping by a mile a minute is never a bad idea. And throw in free food, you're golden.</p>

<p>See you there.</p>
