<h1>Influenced by</h1>

<p>Sometimes when I'm working at home I have the TV tuned to one of
the all-music channels. Don't laugh, it's how I hear nearly all new
music. (Although said quanity is pathetic, my 21-year old self
sneering in disgust.) Since it's TV they have to show
<b>something</b>, so they divide the screen into a crawlspace at
either the bottom or the top, and a photospace. The ratio is 25/75,
and typically the photospace will cycle through shots of the band, and
have a thumbnail of the album cover along with the artist, song and
album name.</p>

<p>But the crawlspace is where it's at. It moves through a series of
quotes and trivia about the artist. Sometimes they're just inane ("Joe
Jackson appearned on <em>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</em> in 2005"),
somtimes they're mildly interesting (quotes mostly, and odd stuff
like "Bonnie Raitt appeared in the 1978 film "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band"). One of the weirdest ones they have is "Foo Band
was influenced by bar, baz, and flurble." For instance</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>"Corrine Bailey Rae was heavily influenced by Led Zepplin as a
  teen"</li>
  <li>"Caillat was influenced by Hawaiian music"</li>
  <li>"Growing up, Coldplay's Chris Martin listened to Michael
  Jackson's <em>Bad</em> on his way to school"</li>
  <li>"James Brown, Lou Reed, Billie Holliday, Johnny Cash, and PJ
  Harvey influenced K.T. Tunstall"</li>
</ul>

<p>Even better is when they don't have any trivia about the
artist. They just blurt out a bunch of trivia about the music business
that I can't imagine anyone cares about:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>"Billboard Magazine launched the 'Hot 100 Singles' chart on
  August 4, 1958."</li>
  <li>"By 1995, country music accounted for more than two billian
  dollars in record sales."</li>
  <li>"Philips introduced the first compact audio cassette in 1963."</li>
</ul>
 
<p>One of the worst offenders is the "Soundscapes" channel, which is
only occasionally on because it sometimes helps Ella get to sleep. But
since very few of the artists on the channel aren't trivia-worthy, we
get a lot more genre-only trivia, learning things like:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>"The world's first teleharmonium weighed 200 tons"</li>
  <li>"The theremin, an electronic instrument invented in 1920, creates a sound with an eerie vocal quality."
  <li>"In the mid'60s Donald Buchla was Robert Moog's main competitor in the synthesizer marketplace."</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope the person who writes these things up reads this, because
they can have an awful lot of fun with the system. For instance:</p>

<p><ul>

<p>  <li>"In 1989, Mariah Carey dealt any common sense in her head to the
  devil in exchange for inexplicable success and nice cleavage."</li>

<p></ul>

<p>Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the 'Adult
Alternative' channel is yet another in a list of things making me feel
old, as one of the pieces of trivia they display is the birthdate of
the lead singer -- nearly every one of the artists are younger than
me, some significantly so. Urg.</p>
