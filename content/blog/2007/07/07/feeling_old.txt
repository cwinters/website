<h1>Feeling old</h1>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/751393460/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/751393460_be1725c522_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" align="right" border="0" alt="Ben Gay on the bottom shelf, cruel" /></a>

<p>Today I pulled heaps of weeds. And toward the end I bent at the waist to pull one from the base of a retaining wall and -- <b>ow!</b> -- went my back. It's stiff and sore and not debilitating, but it makes me feel much older than 37. If it was because I was jumping my BMX over a house, cool. Pulling weeds? Not, just OLD.</p>

<p>As a result on my grocery trip to pick up ice cream stuff for Casey's family, I also picked up some Ben Gay. MORE OLD. And it was on the bottom shelf, which seems just cruel to me.
