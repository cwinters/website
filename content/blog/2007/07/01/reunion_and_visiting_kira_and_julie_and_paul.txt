<p>Last Sunday we went to my family reunion in Centerville, Indiana,
outside of Richmond. Both my mom and dad are from the area, but this
is the family from my father's side. My dad and stepmother came up
from Florida, as did one of his sisters and her husband. My cousin and
his family from Scottsdale (Az.) also came, along with a bunch of
other people, including my cousin <a
href="http://www.kirkwinters.com/">Kirk</a> and his baby-loving wife
who kept saying "Chunk!" every time she saw Ella. We missed my sister
who wasn't able to come because of crappy work stuff.</p>

<p>Another person who came was another Chris Winters. And not the
pretty boy one, either (no google juice for him). This one is a
podiatrist in the Indianapolis area and he's actually related to me, a
few generations back. It was his first visit to the reunion which he
found from Kirk's site. Hooray internets. (He had seen the pretty boy
Chris on the internet -- who doesn't google their own name? -- but
hadn't seen the Christopher Winters on the Vietnam Memorial.)</p>

<p>It was great to see everyone, if a little short. And everyone loved
Ella, of course. The weather wasn't so great, but the house where we
held it was. Everywhere you looked out back there was a little pond or
a bridge, or set of rocks piled up nicely. He put a gigantic amount of
work into both the inside and the outside, and it made me feel pretty
lame for not wanting to pull weeds from our little front yard
hillside. </p>

<p>After the reunion we drove up to Madison ostensibly to see Julie
and Paul, but really to introduce Ella to her future BFF Kira, who is
five weeks younger and just a hair less cute. (It is as impossible for
me to say that another baby is as cute as Ella as it is for our
President to admit a mistake.) <br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Like any two babies close in age, Kira and Ella are fairly
different. Ella smiles more easily, but Kira seems to smile more
deeply and has more facial expressions. (Don't believe me? 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/92586047@N00/">See for yourself</a>.) 
Barb said her laugh is more adult like, building up rather than
bursting out. Ella is taller and more solid (even considering that
she's five weeks older), but she also started out bigger. Kira can't
sit up as well yet, but she moves her legs like she's ready to go
swimming next week. </p>

<p>
<p>One of the things that struck me was how our vacation was
fundamentally different. Ella is always the first thing when we're
thinking about something to do: if we eat there, will it be baby
friendly? Will there be a changing table in any of the stores we're
going, or will we have to use a concrete bench? Will we be out too
long past the last feeding? And if so, where will Barb be able to feed
her? Traveling around with both Kira and Ella only multiplied this
because their scheduled weren't synchronized, but it was still
fun. Just different.<br clear="all" /> </p>

<p>We had one funny nursing incident: at a 
<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/home/AVOLS/">really cool bookstore</a>,
Barb took Ella to a nook far in the back with a stool, the US history
section. Julie followed a few minutes later, and I hung around the
nook's entry to let people know that there were two nursing mothers in
there -- they could still come in, of course, but some people are
weird about breastfeeding in public, even out-of-sight public. There
was only one person, and after I gave him the warning he said, "Oh, I
thought there were just a bunch of history lovers back here."</p>

<p>My impressions of Madison: didn't see that much, but it seemed like
a typical college town -- great. Only 200K people (with UW in
session), and they had tons of different types of food: Afghan, Thai,
Vietnamese, Japanese. Great walking area, tons of bicycles
everywhere. The only part that sucks is the weather, which Paul says
makes it basically uninhabitable for 33% of the year.
