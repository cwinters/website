<h1>Things Ella loves</h1>

<p>A list that's sure to grow:</p>

<p><b>Cats</b>: She gets happy and excited when she sees the cats,
especially when they're actually doing something. (Not often.)
Yesterday Barb called me at work and just said, "Listen to this."
Then I heard Ella cackle and laugh for a half-minute like she'd just
heard the best joke in the world, just from watching La Choy was
playing with a popsicle stick. It was the cutest thing I ever
heard. When she sees them just walking by she'll hold her arms out and
punch her tummy, all with her mouth open (a sure sign she's
happy).</p>

<p><b>Singing</b>: I have an awful singing voice, but to Ella I might
as well be Justin Timberlake. It doesn't matter what I'm singing,
although she's partial to doo-doo-doo ditties. For instance, she
absolutely loves the Mission: Impossible theme. <br clear="all" /></p>

<p><b>People</b>: When Ella sees new people, especially smiling
people, she usually opens her mouth and spreads her arms out, which
lead people to immediately think she's the most wonderful baby
ever. (Neat trick.)</p>

<p><b>Elmo</b>: She doesn't watch a lot of TV, but she loves Sesame
Street. In particular the live-action stuff (puppets and people), not
so much the animations. It's weird how quickly she latched on to Elmo
and, to a lesser extent, Big Bird. It might be the colors combined
with the high-pitched voice, I dunno. <br clear="all" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/442996240/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/442996240_7e03cd3ecd_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pay up or the hand gets it!" border="0" align="right" /></a>

<p><b>Her hands</b>: she's constantly jamming them in her mouth, which
means they're constantly covered in drool and thus perfect attractors
for all the cat hair in the house. (Yuck, but at least she won't be
allergic.)</p>

<p><b>Walking around outside</b>: If she's getting fussy a sure way to
get her to calm down is to walk outside of the house with her over my
shoulder. She gets fascinated by cars going down the street, by birds
flying around, by the shrubs and grass and weeds. Thursday we had some
fierce thunderstorms, and I was surprised that she not only liked the
hard rain and the water gushing down the street, but wasn't scared at
all by the thunder. Hopefully that's not something she'll learn.</p>
