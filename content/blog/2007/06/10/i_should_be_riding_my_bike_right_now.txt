<h1>I should be riding my bike right now</h1>


<p>Hanging my head, I'm writing to you from the comfort of my couch
rather than a few hours into the second day of the MS 150. Last year
was my first year for this and I did pretty well, really sticking to a
good exercise schedule so that the longest two bike rides I took, on
successive days, didn't leave me in lots of pain.</p>

<p>Since I did so well I got a new (used) bike a month or two later, a
Cannondale T1000. It was only a year old and barely used (hooray for
ebay!) and I couldn't wait to see how training and riding would be. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I underestimated how much time both Ella and my job
would take up, and as a result I've not gone on any rides this
year. None. It's difficult to go on long rides around my house (lots
of cars, stop signs and hills, an awful combination) and going off to
a ride on a local trail (like Montour) winds up being a big
production, as everything is nowadays.</p>

<p>I hope to get back on the saddle soon, and definitely hope to get
back to the MS 150 (and other long rides) next year. For now, I'll
just have to live with the lameness.</p>
