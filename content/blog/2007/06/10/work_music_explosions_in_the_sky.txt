<h1>Work music: Explosions in the Sky</h1>

<p>I tend to only listen to music while I'm working, and while I'm
working I can only listen to music I've either heard a million times
before or that has no words. With so much work lately I've been
listening a lot, and the two CDs topping the repetitive play charts
are both from Explosions in the Sky.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's a weird name. And the names of the albums are no better,
smacking of oh-so-emotional turbulent teenhood or something: "All of a
Sudden I Miss Everyone" and "The Earth is not a Cold Dead Place". (I
feel silly even just typing them out, sheesh.) Similarly, the band is
categorized as 'post-rock', another name I hated immediately on
hearing it because it doesn't mean anything. Even the term 'rock' is
so vague as to be useless, so anything that uses 'rock' as a base for
modification is even worse. But it'd be a mistake to skip them on the
names alone.  <br clear="all" /></p>

<p>If you've seen the excellent film 
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0390022/">Friday Night Lights</a> you've heard Explosions in the Sky. In fact that's how I found them -- the
music playing toward the end as the seniors are saying wistful but
tough goodbyes kept sticking in my head. It's repetitive, but they
find these chords that impart a wide-open sense of loneliness. The
feel of it, in particular the guitars, occasionally remind me a little
of U2 20+ years ago.</p>

<p>Anyway, highly recommended, especially for trying to get in a
programming flow. <br clear="all" /></p>
