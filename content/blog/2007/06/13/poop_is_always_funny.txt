<h1>Poop is always funny</h1>

<p>A week or so ago I sent to see a movie[1] and after the show hit the head. At the adjacent urinal was a teenager, maybe 14. And in the stall on my other side was someone in some trouble, otherwise why the hell would you willingly use a movie theater stall?</p>

<p>Guy in stall grunts a little, then lets out some long squeaky gas. Kid next to me snickers for a second, then tries to swallow it. Me too.</p>

<p>I hope I never stop laughing at farts. (<a href="http://www.joestump.net/2006/01/how-to-poop-at-work.html">suggested reading</a>)</p>
