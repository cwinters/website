<h1>Five or so things clogging up my google reader</h1>

<p>...and thus, five things I'm really interested in right now, otherwise they get the 'mark all as read' treatment:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>REST, in the top five for the last year or so. In particular the recent discussion of Atom prompted by <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/09/WhyGDataAPPFailsAsAGeneralPurposeEditingProtocolForTheWeb.aspx">this</a>  and other discussions of whether REST needs a description language (like WADL). I'm tending toward "no" just because I think a description language only gets you at most 80% of what you actually need, and it makes people think that the other 20% doesn't matter. (Numbers pulled out of nowhere, thanks.)</li>
  <li>Scala, Erlang, and other languages that make concurrency much easier. </li>
  <li>Sorta piggybacking on this are other JVM languages like JRuby -- congrats on hitting 1.0, it's huge.</li>
  <li>Catching up with <a href="http://www.stellman-greene.com/">Andrew and Jenny's site</a> because the old RSS feed I had expired silently. Great stuff.</li>
<li>Assorted enterprise architecture stuff, especially messaging.</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/denovich/">Two scoops of great photos</a> from Mark and Deb and their travels.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Oh yeah, did I mention I switched to google reader from bloglines? After Mark posted about his experience a while ago I tried it out, didn't look back. It wasn't <b>that</b> much better than bloglines, but migration was a snap, and it's one less login...)</p>
