<h1>Saga of the new car (ending: hooray for Valley Honda)</h1>

<p>Two weeks ago we had two cars: a 1991 Honda Accord (155K miles) and a
1999 Saturn SC2 (86K miles). We bought both used -- the Honda from
friends about 2.5 years ago, when it only had 130K miles; the Saturn
when it was two years old, with 24K miles.</p> 

<p>We also have a baby who is off the growth charts, which means in
about a pound and a half she would be too big for her car seat.  But
since she's only six months she needs to be rear-facing, which means
the replacement car seat needed to be a convertible one. A little research
and a few chats with work folks and we picked up the 
<a href="http://www.britaxusa.com/products.cfm?action=showproduct&pro_id=7c71c785-4fba-422d-83dc419b3d5b8213">Britax Marathon</a>. 

<p>One co-worker had one caveat: "It's big." True, true -- too big for
the Saturn, and Ella couldn't be in the Honda because it's unreliable
(sometimes didn't start when it was too hot, no A/C). So a new car was
in order. And quick, since we'd be going to Indiana and Wisconsin
soon.</p>

<p>Now, we're not entirely negligent, we did anticipate getting a new
car, just not so soon, I figured it wouldn't be necessary until the
fall, and we might take advantage of what some sites say is a need for
dealers to get used cars off the lot when the new models come in. So I
hadn't done any research beyond knowing we needed something reliable
and 'family', which due to my laziness meant a Honda Accord. One of my
co-workers was trading in his 2000 Accord, but he was having a few
problems with it that in all likelyhood would have been taken care of,
but if they weren't it would have been kinda weird.</p>

<p>So I called up one of the folks at 
<a href="http://www.valleyhonda.net/">Valley Honda</a>, one he was
dealing with and who has a spouse working at Vocollect. He didn't have
anything matching what I wanted at the time, but I asked him to give
me a ring if anything showed up. The next day he did: clean 2000
Toyota Camry, low miles (52K). Sounded perfect.</p>

<p>I went in a couple days later to check it out. It drove okay (even
though it was the LE version), and he gave me a good price on it, so I
committed to get it. Barb was a little wary because things were too
easy, but I figured it would be okay. A couple days later we went to
trade in the old Honda, and after driving the Camry a bit, Barb
scrunched her nose. "Someone smoked in here," she said. I shrugged it
off, figuring that whatever detailing they did would have taken care
of it and that it would have faded after a while. Let this be a lesson
to my future self: Barb's nose never lies!</p>

<p>A little while later, the Camry was ours. Barb was still wary, but
I felt pretty happy the whole car thing was over quickly. The car did
smell a little funny, but with some more research I found that people
had good results with simple things like baking soda and coffee
grounds.</p>

<p>Two days and some internet research later, Barb was really
worried. Apparently long-term smoke in a car is very difficult to get
out. And not just the smell: all those nasty chemicals they put into
cigarettes, along with the nicotine and tar, just worm themselves into
the upholstery and are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
remove.</p>

<p>So after some arguing (due to my state of denial), we decided to
get another car. Unfortunately, PA doesn't have a buyer's remorse law
for used vehicles so we couldn't just give it back, so it would be a trade-in. Barb and I agreed that if they didn't give us a certain amount for the Camry we'd walk and take our chances somewhere else.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we were willing to spend a little more money. (That's always a good wheel greaser.) And of
the used vehicles Valley had we were interested in a couple, one of which
was a Subaru Forester. One of my co-workers has one of these and he
likes it a lot, but it felt a little big to me. (I dislike driving big
cars because I have really bad vision in my right eye and thus a big
blind spot.)</p>

<p>After driving it around for a few minutes I felt better -- it
didn't feel as much like a big car as I thought it would. So, likely
because the car we wanted was a few thousand more and because the
Camry would be really easy to move off the lot, they gave us in trade
exactly what we paid for the Camry. As a result the whole episode wound up costing us some money,
but not much. And after driving the Forester for ~1500 miles over the
last week and a half, we're very happy.</p>
