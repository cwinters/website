<h1>Happy eight months, stinkyface!</h1>

<p>Eight months ago today we met Ella, and we've been remarkably lucky since. She's growing and learning like crazy that her time with us is both compressed and expanded: it seems like such a short time ago we brought her home, scared and jubilant at this new life, it seems like such a long time ago that she last slept in her swing, or couldn't pick herself up off her back.</p>

<p>The only way we could be happier is if she picked the winning powerball numbers last weekend. <br clear="all" /></p>
