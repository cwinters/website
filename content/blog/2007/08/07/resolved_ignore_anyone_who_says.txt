<h1>Resolved: ignore anyone who says...</h1>

<p>"face it" when trying to convince someone of anything. As in, "Let's face it, everybody knows that furbles blorbicate way more than they nooble." Declaring a fact correct doesn't make it so</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/08/perl_is_dead_long_live_perl.html">chromatic's recent post</a>, where multiple commenters tried this, like "Face it the main languages used today are Java, C/C++,C#, and Python." or "Face it -- by the time they release it [Perl6] (around the time when Duke Nukem comes out, I'm sure), Ruby will have already overtaken Perl5."</p>
