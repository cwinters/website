<h1>Another reason I love my wife</h1>

<p>While watching some documentary on arctic wildlife, a commercial came on aimed at the inability of men to think of a gift for our honeys. It told us: "Men, here are the only three words you need to know for Valentine's Day: <b>Vermont Teddy Bear</b>"</p>

<p>Laughing at the absurdity, Barb nearly choked keeping her water in so she didn't spit it all over Ella.</p>

<p>(<b>Updated</b> to reflect that the reason is her laughter, not that she kept the water off Ella. I also love her for pointing out that ambiguity.)</p>
