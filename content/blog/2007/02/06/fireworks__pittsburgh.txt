<h1>Fireworks + Pittsburgh</h1>

<p>On seeing <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap070205.html">this amazing photo</a> of fireworks, lightning and a comet in the same photo, my second thought was, "I know which one Pittsburghers would be paying attention to..."</p>

<p>I'm not sure what it is, but Pittsburghers are bonkers for fireworks -- even more than other Americans. I have no proof of my assertion, but as a bit of evidence, check out the <a href="http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=pit&m=8&y=2007">Pirates schedule for August</a> [1]. In particular, August 16-18, which not only features <b><blink>Skyblast</blink></b>, but First Strike through Third Strike of the blessed event. Oh yeah, it also features Styx (Aug 16), Smashmouth (Aug 17) and local favorite Poverty Neck Hillbillies (Aug 18).</p>

<p><i>[1]</i>: I had a brief recoil when I typed 'pirates.com' to reach that site, fearing I might get something related to... well, to another type of pirate. See also: Dick's Sporting Goods.</p>

<p><i>[2]</i>: Hey, look, the blink tag still works!</p>
