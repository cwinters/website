<h1>My walkable score</h1>

<p>According to WalkScore, <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/get-score.php?street=1529+Alabama+Avenue%2C+Pittsburgh%2C+PA+15216&go=Go">our house gets a 86/100</a>, which seems high to me, but there it is. That said, whenever I go to Squirrel Hill I wish we still lived there, home prices notwithstanding.</p>
