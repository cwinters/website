<h1>Consumer Product Safety Commission has feeds</h1>

<p>If you go to the <a href="http://www.recalls.gov/">main site</a> you won't see any hint of them. And they won't show up even if you click on the 'Consumer Products' tab. But <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prerel.html">drill down one level further</a>, to the CPSC's actual website, and you'll see orange XML icons littered all over the place. Yay!</p>
