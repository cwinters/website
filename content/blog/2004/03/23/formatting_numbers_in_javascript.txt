<h1>Formatting numbers in Javascript</h1>

<a href="http://www.chimie.fundp.ac.be/javas/js_format.html">JavaScript Formatting Methods</a> - It always amazes me how mainstream languages (like Java and JavaScript) can totally ignore printf/sprintf, or make the same functionality such a PITA to use that you wind up immplementing a half-assed version of it so you can concisely do what you need.

<p>Anyway, this library seems to work pretty well, even though it's six years old...</p>
