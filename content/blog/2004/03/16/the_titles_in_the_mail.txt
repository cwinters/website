<h1>The title's in the mail...</h1>

What a nice feeling: in preparation for buying a house in the next few months (more on that soon) we paid off the rest of our car loan at the beginning of this month. One less item on the credit report. And it sure is nice getting that title in your hands, even though previously I never thought about who actually owned the thing. This is my first car, unlike <a href="http://mark.denovich.org/archives/000624.html">some people</a> who need to take an older car to the scrapheap to make room in the driveway...

<p>BTW, we got the loan through <a href="http://northsidebank.com/">NorthSide Bank</a>, who seemed decent enough. I don't think auto loans are very tricky though, but it's another datapoint for somebody to google from the future.</p>
