<h1>Number of methods vs. number of objects</h1>

I wonder which is generally easier for people to learn and remember. For me, it's easier to learn a system with fewer objects but easier to remember with fewer methods per object. That said, I suppose that really depends on what type of methods they are -- you might have a set of DAOs with the same five methods (fetch, create, update, remove, findByQuery) and a hundred objects with these methods, each representing a domain object. This seems easier to remember, even if learning all the domain objects takes a little while. Or you could create a DAO-per-system-area and use the same five methods but with the object name attached (fetchFoo, createFoo, etc).
