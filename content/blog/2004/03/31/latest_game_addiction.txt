<h1>Latest game addiction</h1>

I don't play games much anymore, but <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">Frozen Bubble</a> is crazy addictive. Even Barb heard the funky music and said, "I have to play that game." There's binary builds for <a href="http://redivi.com/~bob/frozenbubble.html">OSX</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbe-win32/">Win32</a> (although I haven't tried the latter).

<p>And guess what? It's in Perl.</p>
