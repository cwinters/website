<h1>Small presentation about mock objects online</h1>

I gave a <a href="/programming/pghpm-2004-03/">presentation about mock objects</a> to the <a href="http://pgh.pm.org/">Pittsburgh Perlmongers</a> last night. It went okay (a little rushed, not enough interactivity), but not too bad for a rush job. Google image search is a presenter's best friend...

<p>I'm lucky I went first. Having to follow <a href="http://www.moertel.com/about-tom/index.html">Tom's</a> excellent presenation and demo on <a href="http://asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> (and a Perl interface) would have been really tough. His presentation and the possibilities for the project really set my mind spinning, and I try to keep away from telecom stuff just because there's so much to learn... Damn those curiosity piquers!</p>
