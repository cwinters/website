<h1>Useful CSS Tutorial</h1>

<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a> - As the HTML for this website will testify I've resisted really learning (vs. just dabbling with) CSS for a long time. Not because it's not useful but it's just one more set of things to jam into my brain and I can't stand dealing with browser compatibility issues. Plus there's the PowerPoint factor -- once you're given the tools to finely tweak the looks of something it can be really difficult to resist spending way too much time doing so.

<p>But I suppose it's time to get into the 21st century and figure out how all this crap works. This tutorial seems like a good start.</p>
