<h1>Back online...</h1>

The server's now at its new home. The only hitch was my confusion about the type of rack it was going on -- I thought it was a four-post and it's a two-post. Oops. So the extra rails I got were no help at all. Fortunately my hosts were able to accommodate the machine and it's safe and sound in climate-controlled comfort.
