<h1>Shifting to and fro in the administration</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/opinion/18DOWD.html">Pride and Prejudice</a>:

<blockquote>Now that he hasn't found any weapons, Mr. Bush says the war was worth it so Iraqis could experience democracy. But when our allies [Spain] engage in democracy, some Republicans mock them as lily-livered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is more than just simple buck-passing. It is a sort of through-the-looking-glass version of how problem-solving and accountability are supposed to work. It also has the perverse benefit of allowing the scope of the administration's failures to become reasons for not discussing those failures -- a sort of self-reinforcing anti-accountability causality loop, with all manner of moral hazards built in.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We've created such a mess that we don't have the time or the luxury to start second-guessing how badly we screwed things up!</blockquote>
