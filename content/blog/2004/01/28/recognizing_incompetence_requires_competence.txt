<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/psp/psp7761121.html">Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments</a> - IIRC this circulated fairly heavily a few years ago and it comes up in conversation now and again, so it's good to have the link available.
