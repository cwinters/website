<h1>Up on a pedestal</h1>

I love my Mac (report coming soon) and find the macfolks generally friendly, if a bit touchy, defensive (who can blame them?), demanding and unforgiving. But all this focus on keynotes and such (like <a href="http://macrumors.com/">this countdown</a>) is kind of creepy in a fawning-over-the-leader-who-can-do-no-wrong way. I can't believe people actually watch this thing in real time... Maybe I just need to drink some more kool-aid.
