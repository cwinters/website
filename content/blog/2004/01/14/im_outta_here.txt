<h1>I'm outta here...</h1>

We're off to Florida for a few days to visit my pop, some aunts and uncles, and get sun, away from this <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/local/15216?lswe=15216&lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared">frigidity</a>. Net access will (hopefully) be sporadic, so adios until next week!
