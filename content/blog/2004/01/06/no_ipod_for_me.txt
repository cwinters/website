<h1>No ipod for me...</h1>

I thought the itunes integration would be cool (and easy, because I'm lazy) so I was hoping the rumors for a $100-150 ipod would be true. Unfortunately no, and $250 is just too much to spend for a portable music player. (Yeah, I know it does other stuff too.) Oh well. Looks like I'll be doing some research on mp3 players in the next couple of weeks...
