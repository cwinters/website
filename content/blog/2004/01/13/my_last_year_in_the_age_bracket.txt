<h1>My last year in the age bracket</h1>

Today I turn 34, which means it's my last year in the beloved 18-34 age bracket. I think of all the things I wanted to do before this time ended: surfing, bungee jumping, skydiving, bungee surf ski jump curl diving... After this year it's just sitting at a computer and hacking away... :-)
