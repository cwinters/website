<h1>brian on Perl certification</h1>

<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4160">Perl Certifications are a hot topic (again)</a> - <tt>brian d foy</tt> doesn't like Perl certification and I couldn't agree more. I recognize that it's difficult for companies to ascertain if someone actually knows what they're talking about in the absence of honest references. (Which, BTW, is a shameful side-effect of our lawsuit crazy culture.) But IMO certification is just another method The Man uses to treat you like a cog that can be measured by numbers rather than as a human being.

<p>Plus: how hardcore is brian to post this from Iraq? Wow.</p>
