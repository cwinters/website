<h1>No, I didn't mean print right now!</h1>

<p>Can you tell me why clicking this Excel toolbar icon:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.cwinters.com/images/blog/excel_print_toolbar.png" width="96" height="120" alt="Excel Print Toolbar icon" /></p>
<p>and choosing this dropdown menu item:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.cwinters.com/images/blog/excel_print_file_menu.png" width="235" height="89" alt="Excel Print File menu icon" /></p>
<p>do not perform the same action?</p>

<p>Despite having the same icon the two have different effects. Clicking the toolbar icon prints your page right now; choosing the menu item brings up the Print dialog. Speaking of which: why can't I choose 'Fit to Page' from the Print dialog? I have to go into 'Page Setup' which has always struck me as a stupid design for Microsoft products. (But I use them -- and most office produces -- so infrequently that I'm perfectly willing to change my mind on this.)</p>
