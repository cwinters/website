<h1>On a winning company</h1>

<a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/business/s_262072.html">Tech council taps CEOs for honors</a> - It's odd to be working for a notable company, even if it's just in a local paper/award. Apparently this is the second year in a row we (Vocollect) has won in the 'Information Technology' category. Two minor problems with the article: we don't have any plans for such a facility in Europe, and our employee count is currently ~210 instead of the 155 in the article.
