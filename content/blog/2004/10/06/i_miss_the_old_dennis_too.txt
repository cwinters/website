<h1>I miss the old Dennis too</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://jameswolcott.com/archives/2004/10/the_costanza_tr_1.php">The Constanza Trap</a></p>

<blockquote>Afterwards, I watched Jay Leno, whose first guest was Dennis Miller, whose soul has sprouted tumors. He belted out the name of Bush's campaign website, and said he was voting for the guy because Bush, man, he begins each day with one thing on his mind. He hops outta bed, "his two feet hit the floor, he scratches his balls, and says, 'Let's kill some fuckin' terrorists.'" Dennis Miller not only sounds like Michael Savage, he's beginning to look like him too, an oily stain possessing the power of speech.</blockquote>
