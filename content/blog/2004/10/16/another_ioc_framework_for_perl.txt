<h1>Another IoC framework for Perl</h1>

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/IOC-0.01/">IOC 0.01</a> - But unlike the earlier one <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/?news_id=3166">I mentioned</a>, this one is by someone I know of (Stevan is now maintaining <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Mock/">DBD::Mock</a>). And I know he's got lots of clues. (Except for some reason he insists on using mixed case method names instead of underscores!)
