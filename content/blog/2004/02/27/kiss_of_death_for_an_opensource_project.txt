<h1>Kiss of death for an opensource project</h1>

<a href="http://jtds.sourceforge.net/doc.html">jTDS Documentation</a> - I have sympathy, but it only goes so far:

<blockquote>Because there's no one to do it, there's no actual documentation for jTDS besides the javadoc-generated HTML and some TDS protocol documentation I wrote during a weekend when I had more time to play around with jTDS. If anyone is interested in writing documentation about jTDS or has any related documents, contact me.</blockquote>
