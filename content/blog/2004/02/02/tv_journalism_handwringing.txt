<h1>TV journalism hand-wringing</h1>

<a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/news/012904_NW_r2_group_deanscream.html">The Dean Scream: The version of reality that we didn't see on TV</a> - Duh. In typical TV "journalist" fashion they:
<ul>
 <li>air an unusual video
 <li>replay it every fifteen minutes
 <li>talk about how unusual it is
 <li>talk about how people are talking about how unusual it is
 <li>talk about how its abnormality it confirms peoples' expectations of how unusual the subject is
</ul>
<p><em>(...several days pass...)</em></p>
<ul>
 <li>talk about whether wonder whether they're playing it too much
 <li>talk about how they promise they'll be better next time.
</ul>

<p>The sad thing is that they'll do it as long as we keep watching. So stop watching!</p>
