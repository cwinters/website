<h1>Great resource for tires</h1>

If you ever need to shop for tires I can't imagine a better resource than <a href="http://www.tirerack.com/index.jsp">Tire Rack</a>. They have in-house comparisons of similar tires, tons of data, and the results of surveys from tire owners. What's really useful for tire newbies like me: you can find all the surveys for your particular model of car.

<p>I wound up not buying from them because I needed tires pretty quickly and a <a href="http://www.flynnstire.com/">local shop</a> having them shipped to <a href="http://mark.denovich.org/">my local car geek</a> would only have been $15-20 cheaper per tire. But I'd definitely use them in the future.</p>
