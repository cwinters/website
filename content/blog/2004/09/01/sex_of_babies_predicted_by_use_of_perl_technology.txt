<h1>Sex of babies predicted by use of Perl, technology</h1>

According to <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/archives/2004/09/taking_the_y_ou.html">Elaine</a> Barb and I won't even need to get the sex of our baby tested before birth. Since I'm a Perl guy and use a PowerBook with wireless we've got an 85%+ chance of having a girl. Wow!

<p>(BTW, while we haven't <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/?news_id=1116">decided</a> the exact timing but it's pretty certain now we're going to have one. More later.)
