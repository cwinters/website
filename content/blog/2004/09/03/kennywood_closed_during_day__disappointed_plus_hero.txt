<h1>Kennywood closed during day -- disappointed! Plus: Hero</h1>

Wednesday Kim and I planned to go to <a href="http://www.kennywood.com/"">Kennywood</a> -- it was my first day of unemployment and she's taking some time off. I was psyched -- all the kids are back in school, it was a gorgeous day (~80 and sunny) and both of us love roller coasters, so I figured we'd get in a ridiculous amount of riding. I even remembered to get sunscreen! I also checked out the <a href="http://www.thrillnetwork.com/boards/index.php">Thrill Network boards</a> for tips from coaster geeks.

<p>Just as I was putting the last of the sunscreen on we approached Kennywood, and I noticed the spinning chairs in the air ride wasn't going. Neither were the Phantom's Revenge, water ride, or any of the kiddie rides. I got a bad feeling. Then the free parking was closed, and the paid parking too. Sure enough, the park was closed -- the perfect plan ruined. Dammit! (I should note that they are open but only after 5 pm until September 3.)

<p>So we turned around and drove the Waterfront to see a movie. <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0299977/">Hero</a> started a bookstore-browsing amount of time after we arrived so we agreed on that. What a gorgeous movie! A slew of breathtakinng scenes are what you'll probably take away from it -- rich colors accented by costumes and textured by nature and architecture.

<p>A funny note about that: all over the theater they had signs to tell people: "Hero is in Mandarin and has subtitles. Refunds will not be given for this reason." I asked the ticket person and she said a lot of a people were surprised by the subtitles....Good gravy, how does anyone take Americans seriously?
