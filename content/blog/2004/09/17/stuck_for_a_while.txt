<h1>Stuck for a while</h1>

The remnants of Ivan have made their way sufficiently northward to leave me stranded in suburbia for a few hours. So instead of going west I jogged east a little into Monroeville, parked at a Panera and am doing some more work on what will hopefully be a pretty nifty web scenario tester.

<p>I'm surprised that Panera has wireless access, but I can imagine a time -- 5, 10 years from now? -- where we couldn't imagine life without it. Kind of like how people view cell phones now versus 15 years ago.

<p>BTW, did I mention that Barb and I finally got cell phones a couple weeks ago? Welcome to the 1990s Chris!
