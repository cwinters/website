<h1>OI2 beta 5 released</h1>

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~cwinters/OpenInteract-1.99_05/">OpenInteract-1.99_05</a> - Whew, that was some work. I really need to get these out sooner. I think the next beta will be much, much quicker, and hopefully after that will be a final release. I also released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~cwinters/OpenInteract2-Action-RSS-0.03/">OpenInteract2::Action::RSS</a>, which is what I use to create the 'Recent Links' box on the home page -- it's just sourced from <a href="http://del.icio.us/cwinters">my del.icio.us links</a>.

<p>Also, hopefully this post will be echoed to my use.perl journal so I can release the module that does that as well....</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Awww yeah, <a href="http://use.perl.org/~lachoy/journal/22161">first time</a> is the charm...</p>
