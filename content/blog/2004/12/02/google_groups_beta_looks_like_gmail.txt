<h1>Google groups beta looks like gmail</h1>

We've been in the market for a cheap used car so I've been visiting the <tt>pgh.forsale</tt> newsgroup regularly. (As well as the <a href="http://pittsburgh.craigslist.org/car/">local craigslist</a> site.) So I was surprised this morning when I saw a completely different interface for the group browsing -- it looks just like gmail! Is this because I have a gmail cookie available (my email in the upper right)? Whatever the reason -- I like it!
