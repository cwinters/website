<h1>Separated at birth? Knuth and Lipset</h1>

I saw a link to <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/rice.html">Knuth's letter to Condoleeza Rice</a> (old, but still useful) from <a href="http://eric.buzzword.com/2004/12/03#a3742">Eric</a> and from there went to his <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/index.html">home page</a>. I immediately noticed the similarity with <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/tipp/faculty/lipset/lipset.htm">Seymour Martin Lipset</a>, a political scientist I worked for as a research assistant. (My first job after college.) These photos don't quite do the similarity justice, but you be the judge:
