<h1>Small email change</h1>

I've modified my sendmail configuration so that I no longer get all '@cwinters.com' messages -- only those sent to 'chris' or 'cwinters'. (Messages to barb will still get to her, of course.) It has <b>dramatically</b> cut down on my spam, and I think I'll actually be able to read my email (rather than slog through spam) while I'm on vacation next week.

<p>But if for some reason you're sending mail to another address here, now you know why I'm not emailing you back.</p>
