<h1>Useful free online books for ACM members</h1>

Are you an <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> member? If so, did you know about their <a href="http://pd.acm.org/books/books.cfm">online book program</a>? They've got a whole bunch of books with the full content online, decent indexing and all. There are gaps (no O'Reilly books), but in my bookshelf right now I have the following just from a half-hour rummaging:

<p><ul>
  <li>About Face 2.0: The Essentials of Interaction Design, Alan Cooper and Robert Reimann</li>
  <li>Agile Modeling: Effective Practices for eXtreme Programming and the Unified Process, Scott Ambler</li>
  <li>Managing Software Deliverables: A Software Development Management Methodology, John W. Rittinghouse</li>
  <li>Professional J2EE EAI, Matjaz Juric, et al.</li>
  <li>Professional PERL Programming, Simon Cozens, Arthur Corliss, et al. (why PERL instead of Perl?)</li>
  <li>and a few others</li>
</ul>
