<h1>Out for a week</h1>

We're going to some beach in New Jersey for the next week. I haven't been posting much recently because things have been very chaotic, and yesterday was probably the most stressful day I've had in years. More when I get back or if I have a chance to post from the beach -- but don't count on it!
