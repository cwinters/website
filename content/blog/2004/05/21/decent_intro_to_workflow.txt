<h1>Decent intro to workflow</h1>

<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=Workflow">The State of Workflow</a> - The article starts out well in terms of explaining workflows at a layman's level. But then it tosses around 'petri nets' and starts losing me before wrapping it up with a useful overview of products and resources in the Java world.
