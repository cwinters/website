<h1>Live in Pittsburgh? Come to our yard sale!</h1>

<p>We and a bunch of our neighbors are having a yard sale on Saturday and Sunday (May 15 and 16) from 9 AM to 3 PM. We're right next to the Kelton T stop so you can even leave the car at home. There's the typical yard sale stuff (appliances, clothes, baby stuff, knickknacks) and a ton of books -- fiction, nonfiction, textbooks, technical books and more.</p>

<p>Location: 1500 block Kelton Avenue -- see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/24cfs">the online map</a> for specifics. More info? Just <a href="mailto:chris@cwinters.com">email me</a>.</p>
