<h1>Short presentation on OpenInteract2 on Wednesday</h1>

<a href="http://pgh.pm.org/m/200405.html">May 12, 2004 pgh.pm meeting</a> - I'll be giving a short presentation about OpenInteract2 to the Pittsburgh Perlmongers this Wednesday. I'll be walking through developing, deploying and modify a 'Hello World' package in OpenInteract2, which will be the start of the presentation at YAPC next month.
