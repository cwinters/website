<h1>Another reason to dig Spring</h1>

From <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040506#1083891934617">Ted Neward at TSSS</a>:

<blockquote>Linda is the Group Lead for the EJB 3.0 Expert Group, and she presented a basic overview of the current mode of thinking for the EJB 3.0 working group. If you want to get a jump on what EJB 3.0 will look like, pay attention to three things: JSR-175, Hibernate, and Spring.</blockquote>
