<h1>Job opens up at another dream company</h1>

<a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20040510/026165.html">[JOB] Senior Perl Developer</a> - <a href="http://opensource.fotango.com/">Fotango</a> is hiring, again. This is one of those times where I dream a few moments for being more mobile (read 'single'). But then I wake up and remember that I wouldn't trade being married to Barb for anything.
