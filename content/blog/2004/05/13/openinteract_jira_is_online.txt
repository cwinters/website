<h1>OpenInteract JIRA is online</h1>

<a href="http://jira.openinteract.org/">OpenInteract JIRA</a> is now online! JIRA is an excellent issue tracking system, and thanks to a free open-source license from the gang at <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> we're shut of that awful SF system forever. Yes, JIRA is in Java, but it's a tool so who cares what language it's in? Write me a comparable one using OI2 and I'll deploy it in a second!

<p>Next infrastructure step is mailing lists (the SF archiving blows goats) and possibly CVS, particularly to get some commit-time issue tracking tools working...</p>
