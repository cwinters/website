<h1>What we really mean when we talk about software</h1>

<a href="http://www.tgr.com/weblog/archives/000099.html">Software Engineering Terms: A Lexicon</a> - Similar to the <a href="http://byandlarge.net/thebitterend/archives/000210.html">fresh look at the waterfall</a> but with 500% more laughs! Plus it's from another Pittsburgh developer who I just learned about. (From where I couldn't tell you. My memory is about seven minutes long these days...) 

<p>What's really sad: at the frequency I'm getting outside and seeing new people this guy could live next door for all I know. Doubly sad because this guy is obviously cool -- he's got a <a href="http://www.tgr.com/weblog/archives/000087.html">post about Nexus</a>! (It then goes into MMRPGs but I won't hold that against him.)</p>
