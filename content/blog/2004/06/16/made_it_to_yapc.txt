<h1>Made it to YAPC...</h1>

The drive up to Buffalo was pleasant enough. Not too much construction and no cops, nice. Weird coincidence of the drive: I burned a bunch of MP3s to CD just before I left and set the CD player (hooked up with one of those tape dongles, ugly) to shuffle everything. Both times before I stopped to take a whiz the live version of Sultans of Swing came on. Could that be taken as some weird bathroom behavior ettiquette reminder?

<p>Also, one of the attendees pounced on me in the lobby because he needed a room. It's all about the community so of course I said yes. But if I get knifed in my sleep or something, somebody please take care of <a href="http://luqui.org/blog/">this guy</a>. Thanks.</p>
