<h1>Updated site to OpenInteract2</h1>

<p>As far as I know this is the first public site using OpenInteract2.  Fully understandable since we're in between betas 4 and 5. There are still some (hopefully minor) formatting issues to sort out but the data migration seemed to work well enough. I do need to declare a server-wide timezone since everything I post is now five hours ahead, but that shouldn't be too hard.</p>

<p>So I happily bring you the obligatory HEAD:</p>
