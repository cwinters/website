<h1>I thought POP3 was dying...</h1>

Do technology people still use POP3? That was my only thought after reading Martin Fowler's <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MultipleDesktops.html">recent post</a> about syncing data on multiple desktops. I don't get it: IMAP servers are not that difficult to setup, and we've had good IMAP clients (web and rich) on the major platforms for quite some time now. What am I missing? Do you (fellow technology person) still use it?
