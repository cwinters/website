<h1>Another page 23</h1>

As noted by <a href="http://vek.perlmonk.org/archives/000719.html#000719">Kev</a>:

<p><ol>
 <li>Grab the nearest book.
 <li>Open the book to page 23.
 <li>Find the fifth sentence.
 <li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
</ol>

<p>Nearest is "Prizzi's Honor" by Richard Condon. I haven't read it yet but I picked it up a few weeks ago from the local used bookstore:</p>

<blockquote>"I've got a studio car with a driver in the alley."</blockquote>
