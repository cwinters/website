<h1>YAPC schedules online</h1>

Here are 
<a href="http://yapc.org/America/day1.shtml">Day 1</a>, 
<a href="http://yapc.org/America/day2.shtml">Day 2</a>, and 
<a href="http://yapc.org/America/day3.shtml">Day 3</a>. 

<p>Yes, that is me giving a three-hour talk on Day 2 (Thursday). This is by far the longest talk I've given and I'm more than a little nervous about it. I don't think I've ever spoken for that long at one sitting. But you gotta start somewhere!</p>

<p>Unfortunately this means I'll miss talks I really wanted to see from James Duncan, Perrin Harkins and Andy Lester. At least I know I can ply James with some beer :-) (Maybe since it's within driving distance I can bring some good Pittsburgh beer up...)</p>
