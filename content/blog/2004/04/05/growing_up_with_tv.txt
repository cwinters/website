<h1>Growing up with TV</h1>

<a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/wire/2004/04/05/tv/index.html">TV linked to kids' attention problems</a>: Take with the normal grain of salt for such studies, of course, but I wonder if this is true of all TV or just everything produced after MTV got popular (no shot more than three seconds, etc.)
<blockquote>Researchers have found that every hour preschoolers watch television each day boosts their chances -- by about 10 percent -- of developing attention deficit problems later in life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The findings back up previous research showing that television can shorten attention spans and support American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that youngsters under age 2 not watch television.</blockquote>
