<h1>Talking with HAL about J2EE</h1>

<a href="http://mrfeinberg.com/blog/archives/000010.html">2004: A Workspace Odyssey</a> - funny stuff:
<pre class="sourceCode">
Dave: HAL, show me the contents of the Cloudscape 
mapping folder, please.
  
A pause.
  
HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.
  
Dave: Why not, HAL?
  
HAL: There doesn't seem to be anything inside the 
mappings folder. It's really quite puzzling.
  
Dave: HAL, is there something wrong?
  
HAL: I have the utmost confidence in this J2EE architecture, 
Dave, and I know it will be a success when you present 
your April deliverable.
