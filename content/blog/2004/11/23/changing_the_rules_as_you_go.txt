<h1>Changing the rules as you go</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/opinion/23earle.html?oref=login&oref=login">A Moral Indictment</a> - Travis County DA Ronnie Earle on all this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A913-2004Nov20.html">DeLay BS</a> (plus <a href="http://www.bullmooseblog.com/2004/11/whats-frequency-kenneth.html">words from the Bull Moose</a>), the hypocricy of which so soon after the election is astonishing. FWIW, I emailed <a href="http://murphy.house.gov/">my representative</a> about his vote but as yet have received no response.

<blockquote>There is no limit to what you can do if you have the power to change the rules. Congress may make its own rules, but the public makes the rule of law, and depends for its peace on the enforcement of the law. Hypocrisy at the highest levels of government is toxic to the moral fiber that holds our communities together.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The open contempt for moral values by our elected officials has a corrosive effect. It is a sad day for law enforcement when Congress offers such poor leadership on moral values and ethical behavior. We are a moral people, and the first lesson of democracy is not to hold the public in contempt.</blockquote>
