<h1>Suspense, suspense...</h1>

Christ, this is killing me -- <b>I can't stop watching election coverage!</b> I should just drink a beer or two and try to go to sleep. Waking up I could at least have 30 seconds of hope before being crushed by the inevitable "We don't know yet" about who won.

<p>I am suprised Larry King has been awake for this long though...
