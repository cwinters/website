"Now more than ever!" What does that even mean? Do advertising people
like it because it can be recycled over and over, like "new and
improved" for everything from detergent to cat food?  
</p>

<p>Baby boomers trying to stay young. Botox and 
<a href="http://www.juvedermusa.com/">injected gel</a> for those
unsightly wrinkles, diets for those unsightly folds, pills for
everything else, People get old, it's not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Job titles with numbers in them. Database Administrator III,
Developer IV, Wanker II. The english language is rife with adjectives,
and there's even a commonly accepted set used in the HR world (senior,
junior, apprentice, master...). Can we at least try not to treat
people like the interchangeable cogs management frequently wants them
to be?</p>
