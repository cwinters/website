<h1>WSDL-first development, yes it's crazy</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://blog.markturansky.com/archives/94">WSDL first
development? Are they crazy?</a>: I couldn't agree more. I have this
kickass IDE that takes full advantage of static typing for
refactorings simple and not, and you want me to write XML instead?
The focus that <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-ws">Spring-WS</a>
has on this turned me off immediately. (At least they made it obvious
up front.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, this assumes you've got a good reason for using WS
anyway. My hope is that it doesn't become the default answer when
people start thinking about integration.
