<h1>A little bit of air</h1>

<p>(Primarily for people googling about Thinkpad T60p temperature
problems.)</p>

<p>I had some problems earlier this year with my Thinkpad
overheating. Under sufficient load for a sufficient time it would just
die. A little instrumentation and logging showed that Thermal Zone 1
was reaching its threshold of 96C.</p>

<p> I tried a whole bunch of things to fix it -- at one time Solaris
was running on the ultra bay drive, so I figured it was putting out
too much heat for its intended use and moved it to the standard
bay. No luck.</p>

<p>Hmm... maybe the fans aren't spinning properly, so maybe this shell
script that tells the fan to spin all the time will help? Nope. I
figured running it in the docking station hurt, so I put it on my
iCurve. It helped but would still occasionally die.</p>

<p>For some reason I'd never done the simplest thing possible, blowing
compressed air through the vents. I did so a few days ago and the
machine runs at least <b>15C cooler</b> at all times maxing out at 87C
when it's doinog a ton of stuff rather than 95/96, even in the docking
station.</p>
