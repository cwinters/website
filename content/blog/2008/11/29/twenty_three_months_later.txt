    Thursday also marked Ella's twenty-three month
    birthday. Every parent we talk to with kids tells us how
    great this age is. Their words fall far short of the
    mark. 
</p>

<p>
    She's an absolute delight. She's talking constantly about
    whatever crosses her mind. And she comes up with phrases from
    I don't know where -- this weekend's is a worried "What
    happened?" when something's slightly out of kilter, sometimes
    with her hands at her sides, palms up. (Example video from
    today at the bottom, about 45 sec in.)
</p>

<p>
    Just about every day when I come home she runs into the
    kitchen with a huge smile, then up into my arms for a big
    hug. And when I sleep in on Sundays she sometimes comes in
    and taps me on the arm and says, "Dada wake" with such fun in
    her voice it's impossible to keep my eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
    There are a couple trade-offs to this. First is the
    repetition. Barb got from the library a Sesame Street
    adaptation of "Peter and the Wolf", and there's a scene where
    the wolf tries to jump at catch Zoe, who's a bird. Zoe gets
    away, but it really upset Ella. And for the last few days
    she's been saying, "Wolf.. BAD" and "Zho-zho fwy way" (for
    "Zoe flies away"). Again, and again, and again. She mixed it
    up with "Wolf back" since we returned the video today, and
    hopefully that'll put an end to it. Eventually.
</p>

<p>
    More seriously, she's now aware of when I'm not
    there. Every day during the week before I'm off for the day
    she says "Dada work" in a downward lilt. And more than once
    when I'm putting her to sleep she repeats it, disappointed
    that I won't be there all day when she gets up. It kills me,
    and I wonder how parents who have to travel a lot bear
    it. Sure, you do what you gotta do. But you really will never
    get that time back.
