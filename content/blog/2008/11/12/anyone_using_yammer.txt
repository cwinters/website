<h1>Anyone using yammer?</h1>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> is Twitter but
  inside your company. Before I started using it I dismissed
  Twitter as a huge time sink and not worthwhile. After using it
  a bit I've found:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>It's only a small time sink. (It would probably be worse if
  I used it from a mobile device.)</li>

  <li>Its transience enables people to post seemingly
  inconsequential items that they wouldn't post on a blog.</li>

</ol>

<p>
  #2 is important because it fertilizes accidental serendipity,
  which can be a hugely powerful force. Blogging goes a way
  toward this but only in a heavier fashion. And there's
  typically too much baggage when posting a blog entry to make
  little thoughts worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
  Accidental serendipity is a concept I've been interested in a
  while. It's what makes working in an office with other people
  worthwhile -- you pick up in your peripheral hearing a phrase
  and follow-up to learn more, or step in to help out.
</p>

<p>
  It's very difficult to do well without near-human
  contact, but for something technological twitter does a good
  job. You need to do some occasional gardening of the people
  you're following, and it's useful every once in a while to
  follow messages tagged to another user you're not aware of so
  you can expand your population.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, it seems like it would be awfully useful across an
  organization -- you can't share an office with everyone. The
  persistence and searchability could be useful too, but IMO
  they're gravy. (I heard one of the Java Posse guys is using it
  and should probably post a message on the group...)
