<p>So here's the scenario: I'm away from home for a few days at our
user group meeting. It's worthwhile, talking to folks and learning
what they really think, getting in their heads a little. (Only a
little, day-to-day caregivers are pretty different than you and
me.)</p>

<p>But I hate being away from home. Hearing "da da" on the phone tugs
at my robotic heart more than I expect. And by the last day, it's
clear everyone else hates it too, because we're packed and <b>gone</b>
from the hotel in King of Prussia less than a half hour after the
meeting ends. Even the bus driver has the pedal to the metal, feeling
confident he won't get another ticket to match the one he picked up on
the way out.</p>

<p>So we get home ahead of schedule, and on hearing I'll be home
earlier than expected Barb has clear joy in her voice. Traffic isn't
too bad, and I pull into the driveway about a half-hour later.</p>

<p>The kitchen door is closed. This is unusual because normally when I
come home Barb and Ella are in the kitchen and Barb leaves the door
open so Ella can see me pull in and get excited. I'm a little let down
but figure there's a good reason (late nap, whatever). I pull my bags
from the car and make my way to the door.</p>

<p>I hear the click of the deadbolt, and there's Ella, naked except
for a diaper. She's stomping up and down and giggling and pointing at
me. I scoop her up and all is right with the world. And that's one of
the best feelings ever.</p>
