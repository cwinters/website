   We ate dinner out on the porch tonight (homemade mac and cheese,
   avocados, corn, in case you're curious) and heard the KO band
   practicing in nearby Dormont Stadium. Ella was curious about the
   noise, so we moseyed on up the hill after dinner.
</p>

<p>
   Ella and I have been around the stadium many times, especially
   last year when a good stroll was useful for sleep. (It's one of
   the few flat places around Dormont.) But it's always been quiet as
   a church, and gated shut. Closed stadiums always look so clean 
   and pristine, the grass perfect, the paint crisp.
</p>

<p>
   Today it was open and hopping with high-schoolers. Flag wavers,
   tuba players, cheerleaders, interested parents, a few neighborhood
   folks. And just as I huffed her stroller up the hill the band
   wrapped up "Bohemian Rhapsody" (seriously!) and took a break. 
</p>

<p>
   Since I wanted her to see the band she needed to be entertained for
   a bit. No problem. She has this funny thing where she's very
   conscious of where she's walking when the terrain changes, or even
   different types of tile. To cross the change she'll take a slew of
   centimeter-steps, once over it's back to normal.
</p>

<p>
   So moving from the ground to the bleachers: tiny steps. Different
   sets of bleachers: tiny steps. Bam, five minutes gone. Walking to
   the top of the bleachers to see if we can spy our house, then back
   down: ten minutes gone. Just strolling around watching the flag
   girls practice: another five minutes.  
</p>

<p>
   And finally the band started back up. At the first sounds of the drums
   firing up to get everyone in line and rhythm she jumped. Then
   when everyone got in position and they started to play ("Bohemian
   Rhapsody" again, argh) she pumped her arms and stomped her
   feet. And even though the band played another Queen song, followed
   by the Doors, she grinned and giggled and danced the whole
   time. Until finally it was time to go home and start the 
   night-time routine.
</p>

<p>
   But I think we'll be back again.
</p>

<p>
  (Granted, that was a lot of writing for very little payoff, but I'm
  also writing these days for my family who isn't here, and for us 
  in the future.)
