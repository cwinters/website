<h1>TNR on the Obama speech</h1>

<p>What I've read of the two articles from The New Republic on Obama's speech yesterday has been thoughtful (<a href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=3af8b076-e28d-473f-bca5-bf23d4805d0e">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=d418d0d8-e3b9-4ffa-b73f-753fb175d4ee">part 2</a>). But one notion that struck me in particular: how kickass would Obama's campaign be if Hillary weren't running and Bill could get behind him? Because over and over I hear, "The only other politician besides Obama to do X so skillfully has been Bill Clinton."</p>

<p>Then again, if she weren't running he might not have had as much of a challenge to rise to.</p>
