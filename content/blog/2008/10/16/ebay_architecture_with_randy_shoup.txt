<h1>eBay architecture with Randy Shoup</h1>

<p>
  Just listened to 
  <a href="http://se-radio.net/podcast/2008-09/episode-109-ebay039s-architecture-principles-randy-shoup">episode 109</a> 
  of 
  <a href="http://se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a>, 
  "eBay's Architecture Principles with Randy Shoup". It was

  just fantastic. You're only going to get a certain level of detail
  in an hour, but it gives you an excellent sense of some powerful
  decisions they've made and the trade-offs that come from them.
</p>

<p> 
  I also wanted to post this because of the generally high quality of
  the other podcasts in this series. They generally get excellent,
  knowledgable folks talking frankly on topics they know a great deal
  about. There's a danger with podcasts like these that they become
  marketing platforms, but I don't think I've ever heard that
  happen. (With the caveat that I haven't listened to them all.)
</p>

<p>
  Some standouts that come to mind are the conversation
  with Grady Booch, the one with Stefan Tilkov on REST, with Luke
  Hohmann on business architecture, and Anders Hejlsberg. (There are
  others, just can't think of them now.)  Some of the not-so-great
  were the ones on refactoring and on large codebases with Jurgen
  Holler.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, well worth the listen.
