<h1>Dual Monitors with Hardy Heron + T60p</h1>

<p>
    A <a
    href="http://www.cwinters.com/blog/2008/07/26/upgrading_to_hardy.html">couple
    months ago</a> I wrote about upgrading to Ubuntu 8.04 on my
    T60p. And in that I referenced that I could get the 'big desktop'
    working but rudely didn't follow up with how. Bill de h√ìra
    mentioned on twitter difficulties with getting this working,
    unknowingly nudging me into action.
</p>

<p>

    First, follow 
    <a href="http://jwylie.blogspot.com/2008/06/ubuntu-804-on-my-thinkpad-t60p-part-2.html">this
    user's instructions</a> and use EnvyNG to install the relevant ATI
    driver. (It will probably work if you use something else to install
    the driver, but I can't verify that.)
</p>
 
<p>
    Fire up a terminal and run the ATI config tool to see which
    monitors the video card thinks are connected. If I run this with
    no external monitors I get:
</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@potomac:/home/cwinters$ <b>aticonfig --query-monitor</b>
  Connected monitors: lvds
  Enabled monitors: lvds
</pre>

<p>
   The 'lvds' is always your laptop display panel. If you now connect
   an external monitor (including a projector) directly to your laptop
   you'll see:
</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@potomac:/home/cwinters$ <b>aticonfig --query-monitor</b>
  Connected monitors: lvds, crt1
  Enabled monitors: lvds
</pre>

<p>
   If you want to use display that monitor to display you need to
   enable it; this requires <tt>sudo</tt> access since you're
   rewriting your X configuration for next time:
</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@potomac:/home/cwinters$ <b>sudo aticonfig --enable-monitor=crt1,lvds</b>
[sudo] password for cwinters: <b>********</b>
</pre>

<p>
    This should flicker both displays. If the external display is the
    same resolution as your laptop display (mine's 1600x1200), you'll
    now have a mirrored version of your desktop. Cool!
</p>

<p>
    To display the big desktop, Click 'System | Preferences | Screen
    Resolution...'. There should be a new option available, like
    '3200x1200,' indicating a desktop as twice as wide as what you're
    using now. Choose that then click 'Apply'.
</p>

<p>
    If things are working you'll now see an empty desktop on your
    external display. Click the 'Keep changes' button on the
    confirmation that pops up.
</p>

<p>
    When you unplug the external display, just go back to the 'Screen
    Resolution' applet and change your resolution back to whatever
    your laptop panel supports.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a dock and want to display and two external monitors
    at once, that's doable too. First, when you start your T60p in the
    dock go into the BIOS and tell the display to work on
    'DVI+VGA'. Restart. The pretty Ubuntu boot sequence may show up on
    both monitors but it won't last. Eventually your boot sequence
    will show up on either your laptop (if it's open) or one of the 
    two monitors. Login as normal and fire up a terminal, then see 
    what the laptop thinks are connected again:
</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@potomac:/home/cwinters$ <b>aticonfig --query-monitor</b>
  Connected monitors: lvds,crt1,tmds1
  Enabled monitors: lvds
</pre>

<p>
    This assumes you're still viewing the display on the laptop
    panel. If one of the other displays is lit up you'll see something
    different. Now, just like before:
</p>

<pre class="sourceCode">
cwinters@potomac:/home/cwinters$ sudo <b>aticonfig --enable-monitor=crt1,tmds1</b>
[sudo] password for cwinters: <b>********</b>
</pre>

<p>
    You should now be seeing a mirrored desktop on both displays. Do
    the same trick as above for displaying the big desktop with the
    'Screen Resolution' applet.
</p>

<p>
    Regarding positioning: I was never able to reliably tell via
    software which monitor should be on the left and which on the
    right. IME the DVI monitor always wants to be monitor 1, so I just
    plugged that in on the left and the VGA on the right and
    everything worked. (There's probably a way to do this, but I just
    want it to work.)   
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes when you dock with the lid closed and turn on the
    machine you won't get any display on either external monitor. When
    this happens, open up your laptop and you'll see the login
    screen. Login as normal, then execute the '--enable-monitor' steps
    above.
</p>

<p>
    I have also not been able to suspend while docked, undock and have
    anything good happen. The reverse doesn't happen either, and it's
    one of the things WinXP did mostly well.
