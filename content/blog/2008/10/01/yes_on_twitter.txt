<h1>Yes, I am on twitter</h1>

<p>
    I don't think I ever explicitly announced this before, but I am on
    twitter and post fairly actively as 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/cwinters">cwinters</a>. Getting the
    username was my initial reason for signing up but it's proved
    pretty useful and (fortunately) not terribly addictive.

    My cousin is a little more hardcore than me, as evidenced by 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/kmwinter/statuses/941475016">his
    posts</a> from the hospital during his wife's labor.
