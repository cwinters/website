    If you didn't already know, the latest incarnation of the
    <a href="http://pghpw.org/ppw2008/">Pittsburgh Perl Workshop</a> 
    is happening October 11-12 (Sat-Sun, with
    a Fri social event thrown in). This is the third year running and
    every year I've heard great things about it.
</p>

<p>
    It's a straight geek conference: just talks, hackathons, coffee,
    food, and meeting other geeks. It's not too big and not too small
    for this sort of event, and hosted in Oakland so there's tons of
    places to drink you can walk to after the event. (For
    non-Pittsburghers, Oakland is the university area of town, hosting
    Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and Carlow
    University).
</p>

<p>
    See you there.
