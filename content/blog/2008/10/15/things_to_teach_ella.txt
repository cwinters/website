<h1>Things I want to teach Ella</h1>

<p>
  Trolling through some old notes yesterday I found this, which I
  think I wrote over a year ago.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Don't prejudge.</li>

  <li>Self-confidence can overcome nearly anything.</li>

  <li>Learn to let it go.</li>

  <li>You can't turn it off so learn to manage.</li>

  <li>You can find a lifetime's interest in a molecule.</li>

  <li>When you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras.</li>

</ul>
