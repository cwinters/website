<h1>On politics</h1>

<p>
  This will be my only full post on politics. While I've been posting
  lots of articles on <a href="http://delicious.com/cwinters/">my
  delicious feed</a> and little bits 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/cwinters">on twitter</a> -- 
  and many of them have substantial comments
  attached -- I don't have a lot of time to try and write coherent
  thoughts down, these notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
  Most people would describe me as a flaming liberal if anything, but
  I am more conservative than that label indicates in terms of
  spending and other matters. So take all this with whatever grain of
  salt you like.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I continue to be deeply distrubed by the
  anti-intellectualism displayed by the Republicans, and by the
  American people. When did it become okay that someone "just like me"
  should be President? Or Vice President? I want someone better than
  me! (I want someone better than you, too, unless your name happens
  to be Roger Byford or Barack Obama.) I want someone who reads
  books for pleasure and who has an idea of the varied forces that
  have shaped our country through history; who can disagree with
  somone without hating on them and indeed surround themselves with
  people who disagree; who doesn't see everything as a black and white issue;
  who's willing to honestly reassess policy stances and ideas. And
  someone who actually tries to prove a point through reason and
  logic and collaboration rather than disprove the opposition through
  demonization and belittling.
</p>

<p>
  The nomination of Sarah Palin is just the latest incarnation of
  this, but it's the scariest to me. We have no real idea who she is,
  just that she's from a tiny, incredibly abnormal state where the
  governor faces few of the decisions and tradeoffs that most of the
  other 49 do, the ones that make the job, you know, <b>hard</b>. 
  (I'm sure PA's Ed Rendell would have a 100% approval
  rating if every man, woman and child got $3000 every year and paid
  neither income nor sales tax, even though he likes the Eagles.)
  Despite her protests tonight I strongly suspect that her intolerance
  for "others" (gays, lesbians, muslims, Phish) would manifest itself in
  awful and inhumane policies.
</p>

<p>
  It's not just that she's underqualified, it's that she revels in her
  underqualifications. They're a badge of honor, she's an outsider and
  a hockey mom and has a family with problems like you and me. It's
  perfectly fine to her that she has little knowledge of the Supreme
  Court beyond those decisions she's heard about in church. That she's
  gone out of the country (or probably even traveled <b>within</b> the
  country) less than I have. That her knowledge of economics likely
  begins and ends with, "Lower taxes means more jobs" in all possible
  conditions. It's just dandy that half of her answers are
  affirmations of democracy, freedom and the American people, why
  should she change? She could probably work in puppies for the other
  half of her answer and nobody would blink an eye. Or they'd blink,
  but then go into how effective the puppies were at relating to swing
  voters.  (I have a lot more bile here, but I'll let it go.)
</p>

<p>
  An incredibly frustrating thing is that the media is joining this race to
  the bottom. Palin's blatant disregard for the questions she was
  asked tonight seems to be dealt with as a "Oh, that's just what they
  do" sort of thing. The debate moderator (no matter 
  <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/your_vp_debate_review_in.php">how
  ineffective</a>) represents all of us who can't be there, who won't
  get the opportunity to talk to these people directly. So when she
  explicitly refuses to answer a question, she's disrespecting us. And
  it's just fine, it's just a tactic that's gauged on whether it works
  or now, how well it functions. How about whether it's right or
  wrong? Is this the end result of all the relativism from the last 40
  years? Everything isn't a fucking horse race!
</p>

<p>
  A few other things, it's late:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
  McCain and the direction he's taken the campaign has been hugely
  disappointing. It's too much to ask for his former openness, but how
  about just non-idiocy. He treats everyone like morons, comes out
  with bald-faced lies, and touts his bipartisanship while constantly
  attacking attacking attacking. I had high hopes for him and the
  campaign, confident that the scorched earth short-term views of Rove
  and company would be left behind. I was wrong.
</li>

<li>
  When did everyone just stipulate that higher taxes == fewer jobs?
  The media lets Republicans state this again and again as if it's the
  sun rising in the east. Didn't we add 22 million jobs to the economy
  during the 1990s while raising taxes?
</li>

<li>
  Barb will love hearing this, but would it be too much to get these
  people to talk about the trade-offs they face and which way they'd
  go when confronted with them? If we cut or freeze spending, what
  trade-offs are we making? We may be okay with them, we may not be,
  but they're never explicit, so you just have this generic apple pie
  goodness -- of course spending is bad! -- without any of the
  downsides.
</li>

<li>
  I was very disappointed by the David Brooks reaction on PBS. He's
  always struck me as someone who eventually comes to good
  conclusions, even though it takes a while to get there. But when he
  discussed the debate tonight I wasn't sure we'd seen the same thing.
</li>

<li>
  I wish they had E.J. Dionne on their program, he's my favorite
  political commentator (talking head and writer).
</li>

<li>
  I wonder whether McCain's position on ANWR (no drill, at least for
  now) is related to his worship of Theodore Roosevelt, and the idea
  that once you go into a place like that, you'll keep going in again
  and again forever, and you won't be able to stop it, tarnishing the
  park for all future generations.
</li>

<li>
  IMO Biden did awfully well. He had a tough job: look professional
  (even boring), don't condescend or get too riled up and just let
  Palin do what she's going to do. Saving the "he's not a real
  maverick" for the end of the talk was quote smart.
</li>

<li>
  <a href="http://rc3.org">Rafe's</a> live blogging/chat thing was
  pretty cool, kind of like MST3K with some mostly cool people I'll
  never meet.
</li>

</ul>
