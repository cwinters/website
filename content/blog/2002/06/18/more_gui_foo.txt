<h1>More GUI foo</h1>

<p>Still poking along with Swing. The ORA book was kind of right and kind of not -- I wound up downloading the code examples and adding a <tt>setVisible(true)</tt> here and there until things displayed ok.</p>

<p>However, I'm now trying to follow along with some of the tuturials Sun has online. For some reason I keep forgetting these exist. And when I remember I'm always pleasantly surprised by their quality and depth, as well as the sheer number of tutorials that are freely available there.</p>

<p>As a result, Swing is starting to click but not quite there yet. A lot of it is forgetting my crippled as feeble HTML monkey.</p>

<p>I'm also trying think of my <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">complements</a>  so I can figure out how to commoditize them. I'm thinking Nasoya, XEmacs and unsweetened iced tea for starters, but I'm sure there are more.</p>
