<h1>and whatever comes my way</h1>

<p>My wife, my sister and I motored down to Florida for a wedding. Normally we'd fly, but we're really trying to watch the $$. And with three people the 16 hour trip isn't quite so bad.</p>

<p>But we did find that the back seat of our car (1999 Saturn SC2) is pretty damned uncomfortable for an extended period of time. We also found:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Burger King now has a veggie burger, but it's as inedible as their other burgers. Still, a positive sign.</li>
  <li>Crappy driving isn't the exclusive domain of any part of the country.</li>
  <li>West Virginia remains the only state out of the ones we went through -- PA, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL -- to have "while flashing" clauses on their work area speed limit signs.</li>
  <li>I have a pretty cool extended family, all things considered.</li>
  <li>It's a really, really bad idea to mix beer, red wine, and milkshakes made with Bailey's</li>
  <li>AAA has a pretty <a href="http://www.aaa.com/">decent site</a> (once you finish redirecting) for planning trips, finding hotels, making reservations, etc. It's not super polished, but it worked pretty well for me and probably would have worked better had I been on their preferred platform/browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>I missed some pretty darned <a href="http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/jilgygland">interesting</a>
<a href="http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/pahphucree">threads</a> on the mod_perl list, too. Oh well.</p>
