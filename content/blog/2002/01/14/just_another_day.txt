<h1>Just another day</h1>

<p>Birthday sunday. I celebrated by working from 9 to 4 onsite  consulting. Bleh.</p>

<p>But we went out with my sister on Saturday night for dinner and Lord of the Rings. (It was actually supposed to be A Beautiful Mind but that was, believe it or not, sold out.) The movie was impressive, but I haven't read the books in a long time (~15-20 years) either.</p>

<p>The fact that I can say I haven't done x (where x is non-trivial) for 20 years could be depressing. As could the multiplying grey hairs and my sensitive dad saying, "Soon you'll be getting into middle age!" But it's all in the head.</p>
