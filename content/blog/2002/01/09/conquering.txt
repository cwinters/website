<h1>Conquering</h1>

<p>I don't know about you, but I feel like I can conquer the world when:</p>

<p><ul>
 <li>A header-only view of my inbox doesn't scroll</li>
 <li>The bus pulls up 20 seconds after I arrive at the stop</li>
 <li>A thrown-together meal from meager offerings is scrumptious</li>
 <li>Before someone finishes describing a problem resulting from code I've written (it happens) I know how to fix it</li>
 <li>A complicated class/object I've created works exactly the way I thought it should, the first time</li>
</ul>
