<h1>Blech</h1>

<p>Went through a rough draft of taxes last night. I really screwed the pooch on this one. Yet another reason why I'll never work for myself again -- these "little details" just get ignored or pushed off again and again until they become ulcerbombs. Oh well, it's just money, albeit money that we don't have...</p>

<p>A few other crappy things going on right now as well, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the allergy fairy is going to visit soon. And all the girl scout cookies are gone!</p>

<p>I picked up some new non-tennis shoes yesterday. It's actually very difficult to find men's non-leather walking shoes -- the only option I've found so far is getting fairly cheap ones (~$20) and going through them quickly. There are places that do <a href="http://www.pangeaveg.com/">online ordering</a>, but my feet are only slightly off so I'm reluctant to try that. Maybe next time we're down in Washington.... Bitch bitch bitch.</p>
