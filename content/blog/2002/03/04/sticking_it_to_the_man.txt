<h1>sticking it to the man</h1>

<p>I'm not very good at thinking on my feet, one of those people who thinks of something to say 30 - 1800 seconds later. So I was very pleased with myself with a recent telemarketer.</p>

<p>She started out: "Hi, I'm with Mumble Morf, a marketing research company and we're doing a survey on marketing and the internet. First, can you tell me if you or any member of your immediate family works for a marketing agency or media outlet?"</p>

<p>I blurted out, "Yes, my wife works for a local TV station." (She is a teacher.)</p>

<p>"Thank you, have a good evening."</p>

<p>Yes!</p>
