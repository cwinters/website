<h1>Back, etc.</h1>

<p>Got back from vacation, with a stop along the way at my dad's soon-to-be-former house to load up a uhaul with all the stuff my sister wants. (My dad and his wife are downsizing in a big, big way.) Kind of painful and weird to go through stuff I used to own and care about, but theraputic to shove it off into the ether of thrift stores and dump divers.</p>

<p>Vacation was very relaxing. I even played bingo for the first time since elementary school. (Almost got the fill-the-card-in-58 game jackpot, but that doesn't win you anything except sympathy from your cohorts.)</p>

<p>In our frenzied day today, we also met our new landlords. They seem nice. So we're set to move starting a week from tomorrow, the big stuff on the 20th. More fun...</p>

<p>Finally: while at the beach I shaved my beard off on a whim. Only a goatee remains. This is the first time since 1993 that certain areas of my face are viewable to the public. I suspect that the daily ardors imposed by shaving may become too great and my previous visage will return, but stranger things have been known to happen. </p>
