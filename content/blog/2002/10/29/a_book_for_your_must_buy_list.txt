<h1>A book for your must buy list</h1>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321127420/">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> by Martin Fowler. Right now you can still find much of the content on <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/isa/">Fowler's site</a>. Great, practical and well-written advice.
