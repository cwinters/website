<h1>Brief look at Jonathan Demme</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/27/movies/27EDEL.html">The Happy Hipster of Film</a> - I find that the people for whom I have the most respect in whatever profession are those who encourage and work with serendipity rather than travail against it. Embrace change!

<p>(However, I admit that I'd like to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0270707">his latest movie</a> mostly because of the gorgeous Thandie Newton.)</p>
