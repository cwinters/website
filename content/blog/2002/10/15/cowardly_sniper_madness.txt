<h1>Cowardly sniper madness</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26352-2002Oct15.html">'The Whole World Started Running Inside'</a> - The last line of this article brought tears to my eyes. For once I'm glad I (and my sister, dad and stepmother) don't still live in the DC area. My thoughts are with my cousin and her family living in Ashburn -- this is some scary stuff, no matter what statistical significances you can throw at it.
