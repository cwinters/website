<h1>New release of Class::Factory</h1>

Winging its way around the super highspeed secret secure CPAN network is release 1.00 of <tt>Class::Factory</tt> a simple little module that makes it easier to create different classes of objects depending on a type. Eric Andreychek (of <a href="http://www.openthought.net/">OpenThought</a> fame) gave me a patch (with docs!) along with a few suggestions to make some changes that I'd already considered making. (You can find out more <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/CWINTERS/Class-Factory-1.00/">here</a> whenever <tt>search.cpan.org</tt> gets refreshed.)
