<h1>Jump in and code</h1>

<a href="http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/jduska/20020930">Joe discusses</a> how open source projects should focus on working code above everything else. I couldn't agree more. All good things flow from working code. Trying to reverse the flow, putting the cart before the horse, is so 90s :-)
