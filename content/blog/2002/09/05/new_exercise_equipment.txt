<h1>New exercise equipment</h1>

<a href='http://www.concept2.com/'><img src='http://www.concept2.com/media/modelB250.jpg' align='right' border='0'/></a>
I went out tonight and picked up a <a href="http://www.concept2.com/products/ir/indoor_rower.asp">Concept2 rowing machine</a>. This is an older model -- the Model B versus the current Model C -- but it's in great shape, and these things last forever. (At least, that's what this here internet says!)</p>

<p>I tried a rowing machine a few times when we belonged to <a href="http://www.club1.cc/">a gym</a> and liked it a lot. I liked the treadmill too, but I had to pay attention to what I was doing or I'd fall off or step partially on the side, trip and fall -- I don't have the greatest sense of balance :-) It was fairly simple to pick up and very rhythmic, plus I could drift off and think about whatever for a little while.</p>

<p>We're not joining a gym again for at least a while ($$), winter is coming and I want to take control of where (and in which direction!) my body is going. So I looked around at the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">usual places</a> for used equipment and had settled on a different model. But then this thing popped up <a href="http://www.pittsburghpennysaver.com/">in the unlikliest of places</a> and I drove over to Regent Square, checked it out and bought it.</p>

<p>First impressions: this thing is bigger than I remember. It's also very solid. I need to start slowly since I haven't done any concerted exercise for five months or so. The Concept2 website has a number of pretty cool features, including the ability to keep a log of your times (with a plaintext export feature), rankings and encouragement with features like their Million Meter Club. We'll see how it goes.
