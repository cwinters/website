I know a picture is worth a thousand words, but I don't want to know even three of them for this. Via <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/">Kevin Burton</a>, who also has this great quote about  Mozilla in a <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1032252791.shtml">separate entry</a>:

<blockquote>Hacking Mozilla is like dating a beautiful but crazy woman. Sure she is hot, and sure the sex is great, but the constant attention she demands and the way she freaks out at a seemingly ordinary request just get old after a while.</blockquote>
