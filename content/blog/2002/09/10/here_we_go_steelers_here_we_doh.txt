<h1>Here we go Steelers, here we DOH!</h1>

<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/20020910steele0910p2.asp">Steelers' season starts like the last season ended -- with a loss to New England</a> - I don't know if someone slipped them a pallet of vivarin, but it seemed with all the penalties and miscues that they were a bundle of nerves on both sides of the ball. Add to that the Pats playing well and you've got instant doom.

<p>Ah well, Cowher's teams always start slowly anyway. I wonder why that is? What is it about a coach, or his preparation, makes a team come out of the gate slowly?</p>
