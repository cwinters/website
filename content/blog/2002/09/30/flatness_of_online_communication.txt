<h1>Flatness of online communication</h1>

Yow: <a href="http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/aeden/20020930">Anthony</a> misinterpreted what I meant by <a href="">this</a>. I'm totally in the "appropriate tool for the appropriate job" camp. When I first started with Java I had a little chip on my shoulder but that's long since gone. I've actually posted a few times on various Perl forums (<a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=144148">like this</a>) for people to stop bashing Java so much.

<p>Language bashing, particularly the type on online forums, is generally done by people who haven't actually used the language they're bashing. So the bashers' arguments -- like: "Java is slow" or "Perl is unreadable" -- get repeated so often that they become truth for people who don't know better. Thus, my "while I'm in the 13 year-old boy mindset comment" -- but I probably should have added more smileys :-)</p>
