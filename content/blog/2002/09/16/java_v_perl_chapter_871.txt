<h1>Java v. Perl (chapter 871)</h1>

<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/qow/archive/184/index.jsp">Question of the Week No. 184</a> - This is just stupid. Not only does the published Java code not use regular expressions, but the Perl code isn't published alongside the Java code. I think the only thing that could have made perlfolk more suspicious is if the article was titled <b>Java 0wnz0rz Perl</b>. (See also: <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/16/1448246">use.perl discussion</a>.)
