<h1>Couple of lookbacks</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21722-2002Sep15.html">The Urban Invasion of The 'Big Box'</a> - More substance than the <a href="/News/show/?news_id=119">earlier article</a> on big box stores in urban areas. This one talks about the different phases of development and the different reactions to the stores.

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/col/huff/2002/09/16/war_on_drugs/index.html">The latest Bush hypocrisy</a> - as <a href="/News/show/?news_id=146">mentioned earlier</a>, Jeb Bush's daughter was caught with drugs at a rehab center. While pointing out other hypocricies of the "war on drugs", Ariana notes that if her father weren't the governor he'd be booted from public housing, she'd never be eligible for a college loan and she'd be rotting in prison. Nice to be white and powerful, eh?</p>
