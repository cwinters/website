<h1>Shopping as lifestyle</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/16/business/media/16LUCK.html">Magazine Imitates a Catalog and Has a Charmed Life, So Far</a> - A brief look at <a href="http://www.luckymag.com/"><b>Lucky</b></a> magazine. If nothing else, it has this wonderful quote:

<blockquote>Many in the advertising community appreciate the mental effort. "What Lucky does, because of its simplicity, is provide a very different magazine experience," said Avery Baker, vice president of marketing at Tommy Hilfiger. <b>"It makes the fashion experience very turnkey."</b> (<em>emphasis added</em>)</blockquote>

<p>In addition, the following has echoes of a recent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020913.html">article by Joel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Lucky is also something advertisers have begun to mimic, often making it difficult to tell whether a page is advertising or editorial content. The ads for Lee offer pants for the "pear-shaped," "hour-glass" and "straight," in a variety of colors and styles. The ads imitate the editorial content which was designed to mimic components of advertising.</blockquote>

<p>When I first saw <b>Lucky</b> on a newsstand I assumed it was some sort of gambling lifestyle magazine, which is almost funnier. There have to be a lot of lifestyles out there as yet unexplored by magazines...</p>
