<h1>Warren Zevon</h1>

<a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/music/cl-et-boucher13sep13.story">Facing Mortality With Mischief Rather Than Tears</a> - I just heard about this on the radio on Saturday. I'm going to have to catchup on his albums. Very sad. But it's very heartening to hear his reaction. It's all too easy to crawl into a shell when dealing with something like this.
