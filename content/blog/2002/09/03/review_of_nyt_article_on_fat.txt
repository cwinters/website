<h1>Review of NYT article on fat</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55532-2002Aug23.html">Experts Declare Story Low on Saturated Facts</a><br>
This is an interesting review of the major points of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/07FAT.html">infamous NYT magazine article</a> back in July. It focused on how the benefits Atkins diet (high fat, low carb) has been overlooked by the establishment, which has focused on a low fat diet which, by the way, is killing our country.</p>

<p>It's a good read. I was a little startled to find the following:</p>

<p><blockquote>"If anything, I think this [Taubes] article has increased the ability to get scientific studies on this topic funded," said Eric C. Westman, associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center...</blockquote>

<p>So articles in the newspaper (even the NYT) have influence on scientific studies? Doesn't this scare anyone? This probably isn't news, but it's rare to hear someone admit it publicly.
