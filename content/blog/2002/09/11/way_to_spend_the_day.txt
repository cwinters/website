<h1>Way to spend the day</h1>

<a href="http://www.democrats.org/news/200209110001.html">Press Release from DNC on Cheney</a> - In the spirit of bringing the country together, the VP will spend the day with the great uniter, Rush Limbaugh. (Also: good thing the writer of this press release forgot to take a breath while writing it, otherwise it wouldn't have the same sense of urgency...) (Via <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/sept0202.html#0911021218am">TPM</a>)
