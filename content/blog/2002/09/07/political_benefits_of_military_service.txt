<h1>Political benefits of military service</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/07/opinion/07KELL.html">Watching Movies With Senator Kerry</a> - Discussion of Senator Kerry and how his war record provides some insulation against typical conservative "peacenik" mudslings. It skates a bit around the question of when it's appropriate to tag someone as non-military but is happy to remain on the perimeter of the issue.

<p>Also notable: a columnist not only admits he was wrong but follows up on the subject to show <b>how</b> he was wrong. (The author had previously blasted Kerry for carrying around an 8mm camera in Vietnam; Kerry showed him the film so he could see what it was actually about.) All too rare.</p>
