<h1>Necessity of EJBs, again</h1>

<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/stories/2002/05/24/isEjbAlwaysNecessary.html">Is EJB Always Necessary?</a><br>
Decent, short article outlining the problems with EJBs. Entity Beans (as usual) get most of the focus, but Session Beans do as well. The <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/stories/2002/09/02/theNecessityOfEjb.html">comments to the article</a> are worth reading as well.
