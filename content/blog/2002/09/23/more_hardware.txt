<h1>More hardware</h1>

When it rains it pours. My server (which runs this website, hosts my email, net gateway, etc.) has been making a funny noise the last few days. It seems to be coming from the CPU fan. Normally when this happens a cable has drifted into the path of the fan: easily fixed. Not this time. New fan ordered from <a href="http://www.pcpowercooling.com/">PC Power and Cooling</a> -- it's actually not drop-down easy to find a fan for a Slot 1 (SECC) P3 anymore.

<p>I also ordered a new motherboard, CPU, memory, hard drive, and Windows XP from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">newegg</a> on the recommendation of <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy</a>, who knows his stuff.</p>
