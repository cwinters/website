<h1>Democracy of least annoyance</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54872-2002Sep8.html">Campaign Jabs Intensify as Primary Day Nears</a> - I was originally reading this for more on how the traffic issue is shaping Montgomery County politics. (<a href="/News/show/?news_id=111">Previous</a>) But then I ran across this disgruntled voter:

<blockquote>"It's annoying -- I can't stand to listen to these automated messages," said Barbara Shansby, 52, of Silver Spring. "They're attacking Blair Ewing. I'm leaning toward voting for the candidates who aren't calling."</blockquote>

<p>There's a high bar to vault -- don't annoy me and you win! (But I don't read about candidates, so how will I know about you if you don't annoy me? Oh the irony!)</p>
