<h1>Asides...</h1>

<p>The parenthetical comment five grafs from the end of <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2002/02/11/bush_media/index2.html">an  article about Bush and the press in wartime</a> reminded me of two parentheical comments I referenced in <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/cwinters/diary.html?start=26">another diary</a> over a year ago. (There's also a little Christopher Buckley xref there too, funny.)</p>

<p>The year-old diary entry flicked into my mind yesterday when I saw one of those dorky little "The Directors" reviews about Terry Gilliam yesterday. He said he'd like on his tombstone: "He giggled in awe."</p>

<p>giggle giggle</p>

<p>Let the oi-dev folks know about development on the next version of OI. Hopefully I didn't let the cat out of the bag too early...</p>
