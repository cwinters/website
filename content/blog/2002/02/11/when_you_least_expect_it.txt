<h1>When you least expect it...</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/classic.html">My keyboard</a> has died. For most people, this isn't a big deal. But I am extremely dependent on my keyboard. When I started my current job, I brought it with me on the first day. (Also to put a little spook into my colleagues: this guy means business. Like a pool shark.) After six weeks of bringing my keyboard from home every day, one of my co-workers took pity on me and hassled a boss to buy me one.</p>

<p>How did it die? I'm not certain yet, but one of our cats was nibbling on the wire a little bit this evening and the next thing: no joy. Looking at the keyboard it doesn't appear that any of the bites even pierced the sheath, but there's still the little cause-effect to be drawn.</p>

<p>I don't know how I'm going to be able to use xemacs without the control/alt keys at my thumbs...</p>
