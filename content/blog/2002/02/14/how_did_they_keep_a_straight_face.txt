<h1>how did they keep a straight face?</h1>

<p>From a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9812-2002Feb14.html">Washington Post article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"I'm not a psychic but the only crystal ball I have says the FTC will continue to stop unfair and deceptive practices," said J. Howard Beales III, the director of the agency's bureau of consumer protection. "It's a mystery to us why Miss Cleo and her employees haven't seen this coming."
