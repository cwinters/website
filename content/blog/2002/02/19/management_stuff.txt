<h1>Management stuff</h1>

<p>Slog slog slog. I've come to a tiny little bump on actions and what belongs in the request/response objects in OpenInteract. So back to the management tasks. So far the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~lachoy/journal/2754">aforementioned</a> scenario is working out swimmingly. I have tasks done to create a website, list actions, objects and packages in a website, test all configured DBI and LDAP connections, upgrade a website (install all packages plus docs and widgets) and dump/install a theme. I've also done the check package task, so just a few more of these (create a skeleton package, install structures/security/data, export a package, install and remove a package) I'll be one happy camper. I can even start doing stuff!</p> 

<p>Did you know parsnips are actually parsley roots?</p>
