<h1>New OpenInteract release</h1>

I released OpenInteract 1.53 this morning to fix a minor bug. It's winging around CPAN right now or you can download it directly from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16810&release_id=120991">Sourceforge</a>. Of course, I continue to eat my own dogfood:

<p><b>Update</b>: Doh! A bugfix to the bugfix resulted in a quick release of 1.54 to the usual places.</p>
