<h1>First rule of robot club...</h1>

<a href="http://robot-club.com/">Robot Club</a> bills itself as "a robot-themed restaurant open for lunch and dinner" as well as "the world's first permanent robot fighting facility open to the public seven days a week." Apparently they're being picketed by <a href="http://p-e-t-r.org/">PETR</a>: People for the Ethical Treatment of Robots. (There has to be a pun in there somewhere for this usage of "picketed"...) Found from a recent <a href="http://pgh.pm.org/m/200301.html">pgh.pm</a> posting.
