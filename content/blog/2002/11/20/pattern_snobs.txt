<h1>Pattern snobs?</h1>

Ted Neward has a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2341">nice rebuttal</a> to Alan Williamson's <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/article.cmf?id=1713">patterns complaints</a>. I thought the original article was setting up a straw man -- yeah, there are patterns snobs, but these same people will probably be snobs no matter what their interest. As I get older I get more fond of the Larry Wall quote:

<blockquote>I do quarrel with logic that says, "Stupid people are associated with X, therefore X is stupid." Stupid people are associated with everything.</blockquote>
