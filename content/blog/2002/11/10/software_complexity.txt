<h1>Software complexity</h1>

<a href="http://www.tmtm.com/insanity/2002/11/09.html">Sorting Out Software Complexity</a> - Tony Bowden quotes an article from CACM. Publishers could do worse than send Tony software engineering books for free since he quotes (and sometimes comments on) the best parts as he goes along. Much better than a whole pack of Amazon reviews.
