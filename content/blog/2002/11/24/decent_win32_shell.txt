<h1>Decent Win32 shell</h1>

<a href="http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/jduska/20021124">Jeff discusses</a> his back-and-forth on comfort with operating systems. I don't have any advice to give regarding the iBook and OSX, but you can grab <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and get a nice bash shell along with lots of other goodies. (Not that I want to dissuade anyone from using Unix, but most of the time we have better things to do than learn the ropes of another OS...)

<p><b>Update</b>: Of course, I missed Jeff's original reference to Cygwin, but he <a href="http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/jduska/20021124">explains here</a> why he doesn't like it.</p>
