<h1>That explains it then</h1>

Web celebrity Ellen Fleiss <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/post/stories.asp?ID=269">gets interviewed</a> by some college rag:

<blockquote>The funny thing was, I <em>was</em> on drugs! I was on Benedryl, my allergy medication, so I was really out of it anyway. That's why my eyes were all red, because I have seasonal allergies. But no one believes me.</blockquote>
