<h1>Code conventions</h1>

In a <a href="http://freeroller.net/page/cbeust/20021125">couple of notes</a> Cedric points out the necessity of code conventions. I suppose I'm so firmly in the IDEA camp that my first thought was, "Hm, I'd see a yellow warning bar along the right and some funky highlighting in all these examples." :-)

<p><b>Update</b>: I tried something along these lines and the popup when you hover over the yellow bar says "Silly assignment". Cool.</p>
