<h1>Open source security</h1>

Cedric <a href="http://freeroller.net/page/cbeust/20021126">touches on open source security</a>. I agree, but I think the binary comparison is not only misleading -- both "open-source" and "closed-source" comprise an awful lot of software -- but misses an important point: with closed-source software, you have zero control. None. (Well, if you're GE or another monster company you probably have some control.) With open-source software my business can fix any bugs we find ourselves, or (much more likely) hire someone else to fix them.

<p>Incidentally, I think on most projects hiring someone for security fixes or smaller features would be a piece of cake and that you wouldn't have to rely on a company backing the project. Money is normally a sufficient reason for hackers to devote more home time coding :-)</p>
