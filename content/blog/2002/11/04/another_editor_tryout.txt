<h1>Another editor tryout</h1>

It seems like <a href="http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2002-11-04#509">Erik had the same impression</a> of IDEA and Eclipse that I did. I haven't run into any CVS issues with IDEA, although it's not as integrated as Eclipse. I don't think this is that big a deal: I don't need to do everything in the IDE. I have to say that neither of them has the CVS support of Emacs (PCL-CVS) :-)
