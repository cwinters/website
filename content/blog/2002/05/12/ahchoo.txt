<h1>ah-choo!</h1>

<p>Allergies have for some reason decided to mount a D-Day style attack. Despite the fact that it rained just about all day. Even taking an Actifed, which normally TCB, just makes me sniffly <b>and</b> sleepy. Blech.</p>

<p>Useful (perl) work done this weekend: zero. Oh well.</p>

<p>We did make an excellent dinner for my mother-in-law, courtesy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580081304/">cookbook de Moosewood</a>: mushroom moussaka and a carrot cake.</p>

<p>FWIW: I'm getting pretty tired of the Rachel Griffiths character on <b>Six Feet Under</b>. I know it's HBO and all, but how many strangers does she have to do? Sheesh.</p>

<p>And finally: I'm happy it's iced tea time again  -- at least for the general public: it's always iced tea time for me -- but there should be some sort of mass uprising against restaurants that serve nothing but sweetened tea. Even in deep Mississippi they give you a choice!</p>
