<h1>New card game</h1>

<p>We also tried out a new card game this weekend called <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/Default.html">Fluxx</a>. (Games are a fairly rare occurrence for us, but I think we need to play more often.) I found it very fun, something you definitely need to devote your full attention to. In particular, I think coders might use this to toughen up their skins for a worklife of continuously changing requirements :-)</p>
