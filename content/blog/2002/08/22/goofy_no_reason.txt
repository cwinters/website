<h1>goofy, no reason</h1>

<p>I've been working at a client site for oh-so-many weeks now (about 4) and forced to use Windows NT4. Due to the draconian firewall config, I can't do FTP testing to a machine elsewhere, so I grabbed a <a href="http://www.theorem.com/java/Free.htm#FTPServer">free FTP server in Java</a>. Setup is easy, and I notice that I can configure the welcome message, so here's what you see:</p>

<p><tt>
C:\>ftp localhost<br>
Connected to temp_1.<br>
220 Iridium FTP V3.07 server.<br>
User (temp_1:(none)): itron<br>
331 Password<br>
Password:....<br>
230- You are a moron.<br>
230 User itron logged in from localhost<br>
</tt></p>

<p>For some reason I can't stop giggling at this. I need to go back to my office soon...</p>
