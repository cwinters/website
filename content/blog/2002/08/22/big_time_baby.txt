<h1>Big time baby!</h1>

<p>I'm now syndicated! There's an <a href="/raw/cwinters.rdf">RDF feed</a> of the news items (and maybe other stuff) from the site. (There's also a 'Syndicate!' link at the bottom of every page.)</p>

<p>Thanks much to John Sequeira for the suggestion -- check out his <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103492/">blog</a> for smart words about large scale web application development using all sorts of different technologies. John also snapped a <a href="/images/cw_rdf.jpg">screenshot</a> of the feed under <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">Amphetadesk</a>, which will be going on my machine(s) in a hurry.</p>
