<h1>Not driven by polls, eh? (Part 3)</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48981-2002Aug22.html">White House Posts Steel Tariff List</a><br>
Here's the trick, worthy of that weasel Dick Morris:<br>
<b>Step 1</b>: Go against fundamental conservative doctrine and raise tariffs on steel (Ohio and Pennsylvania still have a lot of electoral votes!)<br>
<b>Step 2</b>: Take massive heat from conservatives and trading partners for being protectionistic<br>
<b>Step 3</b>: Erode the tariffs piecemeal but don't let anyone know, especially those people from Pennsylvania and Ohio<br>
<b>Voil&aacute;</b> - you're on both sides of the issue! If you play your cards right, you'll be loved by everyone. If not, you'll be hated by everyone. Good luck!
