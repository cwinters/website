Gov. Bush draws ire for appointee</a><br>
This is lame when anyone does it, liberal or conservative. From what it sounds like, the guy they're railing against didn't write the paper people are (rightly) up in arms about, nor did he have any content control. But he's associated with it, which is enough for the kneejerk fearmongers so abundant across the political spectrum. People like this are tearing the country apart.
