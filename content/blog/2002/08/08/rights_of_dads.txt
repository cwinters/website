<h1>Rights of Dads</h1>

Might as well start off more consistent posting with something a little controversial...</p>

<p>This seems to be a have cake/eat cake too scenario: mothers overwhelmingly bear the burden of raising unwanted children while men have the luxury of skipping out, confident in the inefficacy of our child support system. Now a man wants to force his <b>ex</b>-girlfriend to have a child -- and they're not even married! Who will lay odds that if the child were born this specimen would be out the door before the kid blows out her second candle?</p>
