<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19483-2002Aug14.html">In S.D., Bush Faces Test of Fiscal Responsibility</a><br>

We can throw billions upon billions of dollars at a pie-in-the-sky scheme to blow up missiles from the sky, but people suffering from a drought don't get help due to fiscal responsibility. (Another note: why didn't the recent farm bill contain provisions for this sort of thing?)
