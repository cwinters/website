<h1>Warm fuzzies</h1>

<p>For some reason, I'm always surprised by the warm fuzzies I feel when I set aside a goodly chunk of time to write tests. I just cranked out a bunch today (when, admittedly, I should have been doing something else) and it felt pleasantly righteous. (Results are in the just-released SPOPS 0.65.)</p>

<p>I also took the advice of <a href="http://use.perl.org/~acme/">the worshipper of orange</a> and changed the build process for SPOPS to be non-interactive. You can set environment variables to control the database, user, etc. if you want to run the DBI and LDAP tests. (Fortunately for DBI, there's already a precedent for these. I didn't see anything similar for LDAP.) You can also run <tt>perl Makefile.PL MANUAL=1</tt> to get back to Ye Olde Interactive build.</p>
