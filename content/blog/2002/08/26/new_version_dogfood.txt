<h1>New version, dogfood</h1>

<p>I did a bunch of work this weekend to simplify how templates are loaded in OpenInteract and to enable browser-based editing for templates. I also worked on the docs a bit and consolidated a number of them into the main distribution. The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/CWINTERS/OpenInteract-1.50/">new version</a> was released late last night (usually a bad idea, but I'm feeling crazy). This morning I installed the new version to <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/">my site</a> to find that none of the news articles were loading. Doh!</p>

<p>A little investigation found that I'd forgotten to import a debugging constant in a utility class. A quick fix and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/CWINTERS/SPOPS-0.66/">new release of SPOPS</a> later, everything is shiny and happy. All hail dogfood!</p>
