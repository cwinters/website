<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1840">The Growing Politicization of Open Source</a><br>
This is an interesting read, but is it a straw man? I don't think the movement (if you can describe it as that) is becoming <b>more</b> politicized, I think it's always <b>been</b> that way. Maybe it was easier to take a more passive stance two years ago when IPOs were flying high and the naive thought victory was just around the corner.
