<h1>NEA soft on terrorism?!</h1>

<a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh082602.shtml">The WashTimes slandered the NEA. Your pundits, bought off, just don’t care</a><br>
Of course they don't, but if you blow quotes wildly out of context anyone can say anything. (Anyone remember the <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F06.html">sweet can</a> Simpsons episode?) Behind the railing against the pundits is a spotlight on some scary "journalism" from the <em>Washington Times</em>. (<a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh082302.shtml">Original mention</a> in the Howler, and the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020819-34549100.htm"><em>Washington Times</em> article</a> causing all the fuss.)
