<h1>More on forest thinning</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/27/science/earth/27FIRE.html">Forest Thinning Challenged as Tactic to Control Fires</a><br>
There doesn't seem to be a lot of scientific support for thinning in the manner that Bush proposes, but they're moving on ahead:

<p><blockquote> Mr. Cohen, who acknowledges that the science on thinning beyond a house's red zone is incomplete, nonetheless supports widespread fuel reduction as quickly as possible to head off ecological disaster.</blockquote>

<p>In the "I can't believe he did something so dumb" area:</p>

<p><blockquote> To drive home the benefits of the agency's programs, Mr. Bush pointed to two areas along a road, one unthinned and devastated and the other thinned and relatively unharmed.</blockquote>

<p>This seems like a typical misinformed attempt to mix up differentiation with causality. I might as well pick the smartest kid from California and the dumbest from Texas, compare them and say, "See, kids from California are smarter than those in Texas." Argh.
