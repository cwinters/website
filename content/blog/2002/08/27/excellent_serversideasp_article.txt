<h1>Excellent server-side/ASP article</h1>

<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">The Other Road Ahead</a><br>
Another well-written article from Paul Graham on why web applications are great. The most interesting parts are the side-effects: what happens when you don't have to do a mega-release every 9-12 months? what happens when bugs are found and fixed quickly? what happens when QA people and programmers are together? (This isn't new (September 2001), but it was to me!)
