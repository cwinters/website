<h1>Look at Barry Bonds</h1>

Good article about Barry Bonds in specific, touching  on hero worship and similar themes in general. Is the reason people get so angry with "overpaid sports stars" is that, deep down, it's an accessible activity? That is, people dislike overpaid CEOs, but it doesn't seem to be the same depth of antipathy because people don't really know what CEOs do. And we <b>think</b> we know what athletes do, but we really don't. We see them for three hours here and there but that doesn't even scratch the surface. Not that they're not overpaid :-)
