<h1>New version of Netbeans</h1>

<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/news/index.html#233">NetBeans 3.4 available for download!</a><br>
Probably old news to lots of people, but I just found out about it. I still prefer <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">JDEE</a> for editing Java -- I <a href="http://use.perl.org/~lachoy/journal/6260">tried Netbeans for a while</a> but came back to the faithful. I'd still use Netbeans for creating GUIs, but I don't do that very often....
