<h1>still here, but...</h1>

<p>Most of my non-coding stuff will be going on <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/">my website</a>. It's really a shame to have the site up and do nothing with it, plus it will force me to eat my <a href="http://www.openinteract.org/">own dogfood</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, it might be useful to post entries to both here and my site. Sounds like a good excuse (finally) to play around with <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt>!</p>
