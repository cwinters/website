<h1>NYT Hill District article</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/national/09HILL.html">A Black Enclave in Pittsburgh Is Revived</a> (registration required)<br>
Superficial, but interesting that it's got national coverage. Also interesting that this comes to attention along with the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/neigh_city/20020711arena8.asp">renewed discussion</a> of how the Mellon (ne&eacute; Civic) arena disrupted the Hill back in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

<p>Also of note: this <a href="http://www.uncanny.net/~wetzel/gentry.htm">description of gentrification</a></p>
