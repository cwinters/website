<h1>Sun and Linux</h1>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/technology/12SUN.html">Linux Is Gaining a Place at Sun, in Both Strategy and New Server</a><br>
Sun is always a puzzle with open source, particularly with Java. <a href="http://www.oetrends.com/cgi-bin/page_display.cgi?77">This interview</a> with McNealy has a few choice words, such as:</p>

<p><blockquote>So, potentially you could make an argument that the open source thing is just screwing up all the revenue models and we aren't getting the advertising, because it isn't the best technology that always wins, it's who advertises more. You could make a very strong argument that says, "No that's messing with it." And in fact Bill Gates may be sitting up there laughing his butt off because the open source community is cutting the legs out from under all the R&D and promotion efforts of all the open interface strategies -- not open implementation, but open interface strategies. </blockquote>
