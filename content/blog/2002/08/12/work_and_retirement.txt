<h1>Work and retirement</h1>

One of the folks in the office today, a consultant, said he didn't think he'd ever really retire, that he'd always be doing some sort of consulting. It crossed my mind that if I'm still programming thirty years from now I'd probably be the same to some degree. Except instead of consulting for work and all that hassle -- bah, money! who needs it? -- I feel pretty confident that the open source community will still be vibrant and full of opportunity.
