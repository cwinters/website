<h1>Teaching certification</h1>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4380-2002Aug27.html">More New Md. Teachers Not Fully Certified</a><br>
This is a fairly interesting report, notable for a couple of excuses for me to talk out of turn:<br>
<b>1</b> - A candidate for the best federal act name ever: <b>No Child Left Behind Act</b><br>
<b>2</b> - Another example of how education and federal regulations rely on common denominators -- standardized test scores, teaching certification -- rather than common sense. Sure, it's nice to know that your child's teacher is certified, but being certified has little to do with being a good teacher. And the focus on certification will IMO wind up driving away a large group of potential teachers -- professionals looking to give their shallow business lives meaning.
