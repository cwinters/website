<h1>Funny coincidences</h1>

So I'm reading <a href="http://www.beattie.info/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021229#164437">an entry in Russell's blog</a> and he notes that he's browsing 
old entries from his IKEA POANG chair using wireless. And I'm reading his blog from my IKEA POANG chair 
(Barb picked it up this weekend) using wireless. And I'm thinking that this is a very Fight Club (pre explosion) moment, and that it's 
really weird that I know this about someone around the world. In a good way, of course.
