<h1>Little sequence diagram tool</h1>

<a href="http://www.zanthan.com/itymbi/archives/000861.html#000861">Alex has improved</a> his small tool for generating sequence diagrams. I especially like that a few lines of pseudocode will create the diagram for you. This will probably be useful in the very near future -- my experience with other tools is that you need to define too much to just create a simple diagram.
