<h1>Intro to a productive Java environment</h1>

<a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/ericfj/20021219">Productive Environments</a> - Eric Foster-Johnson has a number of excellent introductory tips on using IDEs, Ant, unit testing and more. A couple of notes:

<p><ul>
  <li>I don't think Ant is across-the-board faster than make: I think it can compile Java faster than make, but IME other tasks are slower.</li>
  <li>You don't need to implement a "-help" target since Ant includes a 'projecthelp' switch that lists all the targets in alphabetical order, plus the contents of the "description" attribute of each.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great job!</p>
