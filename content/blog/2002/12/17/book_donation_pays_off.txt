<h1>Book donation pays off</h1>

Six weeks ago Nick Tonkin <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/modperl@apache.org/msg30907.html">posted a message</a> on the modperl mailing list asking for used copies of <b>Learning Perl</b> for a class he'd be teaching to disadvantaged kids. I emailed him back about a copy of the <b>Perl Cookbook</b> I had but hadn't used in a while, and he said "Send it on!" and thanked me warmly.

<p>I figured that was that, good karma and all. But today I get back from my wife's holiday party -- teachers are so catty! :-) -- and I have six emails with subjects like "gracias por los libros" and "hi thanks for the book!!!!!!!" Not only that, but a few of the students included the Perl code they used to generate the emails. Awesome! (And to think I almost deleted a few because of the similarity to spam subjects...)</p>
