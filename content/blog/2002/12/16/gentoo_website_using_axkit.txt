<h1>Gentoo website using AxKit</h1>

I just noticed that the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo linux</a> website is using the <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit</a> application server. This always seemed like a smart way to generate and manage content -- I think it's similar to Cocoon, but in Perl -- but I've got too many application servers on my plate already. The <a href="http://axpoint.axkit.org/">AxPoint</a> presentation tool looks nifty as well.
