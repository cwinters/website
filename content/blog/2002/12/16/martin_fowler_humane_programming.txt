<h1>Martin Fowler: Humane Programming</h1>

<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/tunable.html">Tuning Performance and Process</a> - Most people are going to focus on the sections on refactoring and tuning -- with good reason since it's the rare kind of advice that's truly useful rather than just sounding useful.

<p>But for me the most important point is this:</p>

<blockquote><b>Bill Venners</b>: Let's talk about one of the four principles: "valuing Individuals and interactions over processes and tools." What does that mean?</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Martin Fowler</b>: That principle basically says that rather than focusing on processes and tools as a way to further your software development organization, it is more valuable to focus on the people on your team, on individuals and the way that they interact at a personal level.</blockquote>

<p>I think if software development weren't headed toward a more human centered focus I'd take up another line of work. Life's too short to deal with frustration like that.</p>
