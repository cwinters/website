<h1>One IDE for the team</h1>

<a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/ericfj/20021220#one_ide_will_not_rule">One IDE Will Not Rule Them All</a> - Eric Foster-Johnson says that teams should be flexible and allow developers to use whatever IDE they wish. Since I like to fall into XEmacs fairly often, I agree. I also agree that you should have a completely IDE-independent build process -- thanks Ant!

<p>However, the rise (?) of pair programming complicates matters for a few reasons:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Some IDEs are picky about working on their own tree of sourcecode (resulting in rapid commit/update cycles as you pass the keyboard back and forth)</li>
  <li>Adding more requirements to switching breaks the flow of the session, part of the reason you get into pair programming</li>
  <li>Spreading knowledge of editor/IDE tricks throughout the team is one of the nice side effects of pair programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a side note, I'd like to see editors (like IDEA) to be able to easily  switch keymaps and other profile-sensitive information to encourage pair programming. Easy like, <tt>Ctrl-Alt-F10</tt> or some other chord that only takes a second to execute. Do other pair programming teams just standardize on a particular keymapping or what?</p>
