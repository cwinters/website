<h1>Another reason why blogs are great</h1>

Like just about every other hacker whose blog I read I have a laptop. But it's not an Apple. It's not even modern -- it's a P150 with 80 MB of memory. 
It's good enough to do editing, Perl programming, some basic Java programming. But running 
X is slightly painful, running Mozilla/Netscape even more. (Did I mention it only does
800x600?) But lynx... ahh, lynx works great. And the laptop has a wireless card in it too. Which brings us to another reason: blogs generally have no 
fluff. No graphics that make sites unreadable. Just text, wonderful simple text. And links, so IMDB is available while I watch TV and wonder, "What did I see her in?"
