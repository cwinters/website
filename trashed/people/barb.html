<P>Barb is crazy about cats, and I'm crazy about her. (Fortunately, she
is also crazy about me.) We were <A HREF="/wedding/">married in April 2000</a>.</P>

<P>Barb and I sometimes have fun with the camera, just making
silly faces. (She's much better at it than I am.). Barb is not only
crazy about cats, in many ways she is a cat.

<P>Very much like a cat, she is very adept at sleeping, which 
isn't as easy as you think. Cats can sleep anytime, anywhere -- a
very valuable asset when you're in the grasslands of Africa and
need to gather your strength to take out a gazelle or something.
(Why domestic shorthairs need it: beats me.) We joke that she 
really is part feline (no hairballs, luckily).</P>

<P>Here's Exhibit B about Barb and her cat-ness. She's imitating one of
the cat's favorite activities: yawning. (This was taken in Annpolis right
in front of the State House.) That was one of our few spontaneous trips: we
just kind of said: "Let's go to Annapolis." without making plans or anything.
It was pleasant, but difficult to find a hotel room since we went in June
when everyone was getting married. So much for spontaneity.

<P>Just about every year we go down to the Cape Hatteras National 
Seashore with Barb's mom, Betty. We stay for a week in a relatively 
small cottage that's very close to the beach. Like most of Hatteras, 
that stretch of beach never gets crowded, certainly not like
Ocean City or other destinations where it's tough to find a 
path to get to the can without stepping on someone.

<P>This shot of Barb and me near the Hatteras lighthouse. This 
is before they moved it about a quarter-mile inland to stave off 
the effects of nearby beach erosion.

<P>Unlike some people, we're not super-duper active. When we lived
in Washington I would occasionally get roped into "volunteering" for various 
events put on by the <A HREF="http://www.washhumane.org/" TARGET="_blank">Washington
Humane Society</A> since Barb worked there. <EM>Mutts</EM> was one of them. 
But this was actually fairly fun, and I didn't have to do much at all. But lots of
dogs were running around, being dogs. 

<P>My buddy Paul Diamond (former ace photographer) took a photo of us that Barb really likes,
and since she doesn't like many photos of herself, her mom, my dad and my Nana all
have copies of this photo. (I don't like it quite as much as she does: my beard 
is really scruffy.)<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<P>Recently we were going through photos at Betty's house and found some 
baby pictures of Barb. This isn't unusual, but what you can't see from
the photo is the back. On the back of a bunch of her baby pictures is the word (in careful 
cursive): <EM>Cute</EM>. Apparently, around age 8, Barb went through all her photos
during one of those phases kids (I guess) have where they have to write something
on everything that's theirs. So she wrote 'cute' on photos of herself. Which, 20 years later,
is itself cute.<BR CLEAR="ALL">
