<title>meet the cwinters family</title>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">My Family!</H1>

<P>I've got a pretty big family and, for the most part, I love them to death.
Every June (or nearly every June, ahem) I go out to the eastern Indiana/western
Ohio area to a family reunion, from people on my father's side. It's always a
mind-bending experience trying to actually trace (and worse, name) the ways in
which I'm related to some of the people there. (I'm still fuzzy on the whole
second cousin thing,..)</P>

<P>First, there's the immediate
folks. By the time they were as old as I am now, my parents were already married for
eight years. Scary, isn't it? The story of how they met is mentioned briefly in a
story I wrote (no, really, it's <EM>fiction</EM>!) called
<A HREF="/writing/fiction/great.html">There's Only One Great One</A>. They made a pretty
good looking couple, I think. 

<P>My mom passed away in March 1999 and we miss her terribly.</P>

<P>There's one picture of them on their wedding day
that is one of the best pictures I've ever seen. It's a close up side shot of
them standing chest-to-chest and gazing into the other's eyes. What did they
see? Whatever it was, they kept seeing it. Together. </P>


<P>I've known my sister, well,
all my life. Her name is Kim and she's currently working at Patent Construction outside of Pittsburgh. Before she moved up her she was Manger 
of a Crown Books in Alexandria, where she or I has worked since 1987. (Seriously --
we have a long history with Crown: ask one of us about it sometime!) We have an odd
relationship, although I suppose as brother/sister relationships go it's pretty
tame. My grandmother recently sent me a tape of my sister and I we made in 1976
for her and my grandfather.</P>

<P>You know how you read psychology books and learn that kids form their later
personalities, at the least establishing the relationship with their sibling(s),
and how you never believed it because kids are kids. It's all true. I totally
dominated the recording, pausing every once in a while only to say, &quot;Right
Kim?&quot; and wait for the affirmative, &quot;Right Chris!&quot; Sobering
experience.</P>

<P>Of course, adults are more complex than that. (Really, we are adults!) 
But then again... she has shown a steely
determination that has, granted, only manifested itself when most other people
would say, &quot;Screw this!&quot; from sheer frustration.</P>
