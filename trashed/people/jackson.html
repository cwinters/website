<P>Jackson is <STRONG>our</STRONG> cat, since we got him after we had already
moved in together. One reason we got him was so <A HREF="/people/lachoy.html">La Choy</A>
could have some feline company. 

<P>Jackson is a <A HREF="http://www.washhumane.org/" TARGET="_blank">shelter</A> 
cat, so he knows what it's like out there in the real world. At least he <EM>did</EM>
know what it was like...

<P>Jackson was a very cute kitten. Here's one of him on the first day
he came to his new home. (La Choy was none too pleased to learn that
this intruder was here to stay....)

<P>One of this favorite toys as a kitten was the <EM>Action Mouse</EM>, which
is a fur-covered cardboard mouse (with some catnip inside) dangling from a long 
elastic cord. The cord is attached to a v-shaped gripper which you alligator onto
a door frame so the mouse hangs down above the ground. Before he got as
big as he is now, he caught some serious air...

<P>As usual for a kitten, he always got into things.

<P>We even submitted this photo to the Washington Humane Society's 
annual photo contest. He was a finalist but didn't win. The picture
that won was Some lame shot of a cat playing with newspaper or in 
a bag or something.

<P>If you have a cat you know it's as hard to 
get a shot of them playing with newspaper as it is to figure out from 
which direction the sun will rise tomorrow. (Exhibit A presented here.)

<P>Jackson does great at the doctor because he's so easy-going.
In fact, the last time we went he at an <STRONG>A+</STRONG>.
<A HREF="/people/lachoy.html">La Choy</A> did not, instead getting a 
bright orange <TT>Will Bite</TT> sticker placed on her 
clinic record.

<P>However, it could be said that Jackson is afraid of initmacy.
He is not as lovey-dovey as other cats and, while he doesn't mind
getting picked up, doesn't go for the extended love fests that
Barb and La Choy have been known to participate in.</P>

<P>In fact, when we first picked Jackson out we thought he was
a girl. His card read <TT>Lily</TT>. After we picked her/him out,
we thought Lily was an okay name and got used to saying "Little Lilly".
But he went to the clinic to get spayed and we got a phone call 
afterward, "We have some news about Lily: she's a he." It obviously 
didn't matter to us whether he was a boy or girl, but you have
to wonder whether his initial gender confusion led to his fear
of closeness...
