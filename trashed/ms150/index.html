<p>I am riding in the 2009 MS 150
<a href="http://bikepax.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BIKE_PAX_Details_EscapetotheLakeErie">"Escape to the Lake"</a>
with my team,
<a href="http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR?pg=team&fr_id=10747&team_id=142275">Vocollect Bluestreak</a>[1].
It's a two-day 150-mile ride from suburban Pittsburgh to Lake
Erie. It's a pretty big event -- in past years nearly 1500 cyclists
rode and many other volunteer support staff participated, raising
over $800,000 for
<a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/research/index.aspx">MS research</a>.

<p>I rode in 2006 and <a
href="http://www.cwinters.com/blog/2006/06/14/i_finished_the_ms_150.html">wrote
a few notes</a>, but I just noticed I didn't include any praise
for the support and organization of the ride, which was just
awesome. Following the roads was ridiculously easy (lots of
guides, plus with so many people on the ride there's always
someone else to follow), and they had gobs of water, gatorade and
snacks every 15 miles or so.</p>

<p>I'll be atop my newer[2] touring bike (Cannondale T1000, which
does not have the ability to morph into any person it
touches). While I'm exercising at work every morning and riding
as often as I can while balancing work and being a dad, I'm
learning that my 39 year-old body doesn't take to exercise like
it used to. But I know from 2006 that enough things will come
together to get me to the end.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the MS 150 is a charity event, so I'm
hitting people up for money. Every little bit helps, don't be shy
to just pony up $5 or so -- it's all going to a good cause. So
you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR?px=6504362&pg=personal&fr_id=10747">Sponsor me online</a> through the National MS Society</li>
  <li>Send me money through Paypal and I'll put your name on the list. (Send to email: </b>chris@cwinters.com</b>.)</li>
  <li>Send me a check to my snailmail address (if you need this, email me).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks again, and wish me luck!</p>

in the Talkman. Plus, it sounds really cool.</p>

<p>[2] "newer" for me means less than 15 years old.</p>
