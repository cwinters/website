<title>cwinters: hardware</title>

    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">hardware</H1>

    <P>I currently have five computers plus one laptop. I know, it's a horrible disease,
      getting all these computers. (Plus one PalmPilot -- save me!) 
    <P>(Aren't minutae great?)</P>

    <P>For input and display, I have all but the the first machine hooked up
      to a 4-port Belkin OmniView SE KVM switch. Works okay, mostly. It
      used to freak out in X, but now that everything on there is either a 
      Win32 machine or just runs the linux console, it's no sweat.</P>
    <P>The KVM switch is hooked to a Viewsonic PT775 monitor, Logitech MouseMan Plus
      and a generic keyboard.

    <p>The first machine outputs to a Nokia 21" 445xi Plus (which totally 
      rocks; I'm getting spoiled by this 21" monitor stuff) and uses a plain old
      Logitech MouseMan (three-button plus thumb variety). I tried using the 
      IntelliMouse, but I just don't use 
      the little wheelie on it. I also have an IBM PS/2 keyboard (a newer one, not
      one of the old clickety ones.)

	   generic CD ROM</P>
       <p>When I first got this machine, it would every once in a while just
         freeze up. Totally annoying. At first, I thought it was an issue with
         Enlightenment (illogical), then with the video card. Finally, I saw a posting
         from someone mentioning that linux sometimes has a problem with memory
         running at 133 Mhz. The AOpen motherboard allows you to set the bus speed
         of the memory independent of the CPU bus speed, so I set it to 
         100 Mhz and kept the CPU at 133. After that, no problems at all.

      <li><p><strong>NT (monongahela)</strong>: This used to be my main machine that 
    dual booted into Linux and (rarely) NT, but it now just runs NT and I use it
    on the infrequent occasions I develop on it. </P>

        This is what Barb uses and what I use for Quicken and random personal stuff.
        If you visit and want to play deathmatch Quake 2, you'll be 
        on this machine. Several of the components (monitor, case, sound/speakers)
        came from a P-120 machine I bought back in late 1995 for more than (ack!) 
        $2700. I think I could buy (or build) a data center for that today...

	I got the laptop in December 1998. It was a PITA to get it, but I've been
	pretty happy with it since. I'm hoping to get another hard drive in the future 
	so I can pop it in and have an NT boot. It's not the lightest thing in
	the world, but people not in the know are pretty impressed when I tell
    them it's running Linux. (One person thought I was a little nutty.)</P>

    <p>However, it's currently got an issue with the display that makes it
     basically unusable. Ouch.

 <P>Tying everything together is an eight port Kingston mini-hub. These
    things are great!

 <P>I also have an Okidata 12i laser printer hooked up directly with yuokon. I tried
   using an external print server so that I could print anytime and not depend on
   a particular computer being up, but Win95 flaked out every once in a while, dumping
   garbage. This happened with the simple PCL driver, advanced PCL driver and the
   PostScript driver. Go figure. Linux, of course, had no problems at all. Hooking
   the printer directly to the machine made it work perfectly. Lame drivers.
