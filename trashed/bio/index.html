    <P>I live right now in the Squirrel Hill area Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's a great place
     to live, even if the Steelers are el-stinko right now. <A HREF="/bio/contact.html">More contact info</A>.

    <P><EM>Interests</EM>: <A HREF="/programming/">Programming</A>, <A HREF="/writing/">writing</A> and reading, food and beer,
      dancing like a fool, listening to music. Boring crap.</P>
    
    <P><EM>Work</EM>: Java Developer at 
      <A HREF="http://www.optiron.com/" target="_blank">Optiron</A>, making the best damn billing system on the planet. At night, I work on this here <a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsOpenInteract">application server</a> and 
<a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsSpops">persistence framework</a> in Perl.</P>
    
    <P><EM>Looks</EM>: People have told me I look like Lance Ito (remember him?) and John Landis.
      Ito, I don't get, although the fact that the guy making the comparison was drunk makes it
      makes some more sense. I actually do (kindasorta) look like John Landis, but since he's a
      famous-by-name (as opposed to famous-by-face) director, nobody normally knows what the hell
      I'm talking about when I bring up the name. Just mysterious enough...</P>
