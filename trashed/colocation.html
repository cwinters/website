<h2>Colocation</h2>

<p>I've been thinking about colocating my web/email server so I can add other services to it as well (openinteract.org, wiki, bug tracking/CVS, etc.) that won't work with my current limited bandwidth. Here are some services/notes:</p>

<p>Absolutely required is root control -- I have to be able to install my own perl/mod_perl/Java SDK/databases/IMAP server, etc. I'm torn between locating my server somewhere and taking space on someone else's server. The root control means only the 'virtual' server is a possibility, and it's also attractive because it's cheaper...</p>
