<title>cwinters: story behind this site</title>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">What makes this site run</H2>

<P>This site runs on a P-200 MMX/128 MB RAM/6.4 GB Hard drive/S3 Trio 3D 4MB. It also acts as the firewalling gateway between my network at home and the Internet.</P>

<P>The software it uses is:

<UL>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> 1.3.14</LI>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</A> 5.005_03</LI>
 <LI><A HREF="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</A> 1.24_01</LI>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www.openinteract.org/">OpenInteract</A> 1.03</LI>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www.openinteract.org/SPOPS/">SPOPS</A> 0.35</LI>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</A> 3.23</LI>
 <li>Some <a href="/programming/#custom_oi">custom OpenInteract packages</a></li>
 <LI>Lots of perl modules from the community</LI>
</UL>

<P>What I'm interested in doing with this site is creating a test
bed. In this test bed I'll try out a number of things, including:

<UL>
 <LI>being able to change the look of the site very easily</LI>
 <LI>allowing you to personalize how you see the information here -- via themes or what have you</LI>
 <LI>updating much of the information on the site via web-based editing  interface</LI>
 <LI>allowing administrators to edit (almost in-place) much of the dynamic content on the site</LI>
</UL>

<P>In general, I'd like to progress to the point where Barb or another
non-computer person could be given a password and edit any information 
on the site. Content management would be nice (particularly with something like <A HREF="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</A> operating in the backend), but that might be a little ways down the road.</P>
